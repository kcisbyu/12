Today, there is a new student in his class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;After his fourth class at the university, he takes two trains back to Fujisawa Station and then arrives at the tutorial class. By now the sun had completely set and the time was past six o&#39;clock. The temperature became really cold, the days became shorter, and the nights came a little earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After putting his belongings in the staff locker, Sakuta put on his white shirt, which represented his role as a lecturer. As he was picking up his textbook for today&#39;s class and walking out of the locker room, he was stopped by the principal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa, you&#39;re just in time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Good morning.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if it&#39;s nighttime, you still have to say good morning.

I have a student I want you to take today......is that okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Today? What a surprise.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;She asked for you to teach her specifically. Her name is Sara Himeji. Do you remember her?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta naturally remembered her, she had come to the class before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How&#39;s that? Is that okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no reason to refuse. He couldn&#39;t wait to have more students to add to his part-time income.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was only in her first year of high school, and she didn&#39;t need to prepare for college in a hurry. It would be perfect for Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No problem&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, that&#39;s good if you&#39;re okay with it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just as he made the deal with the principal&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A girl came out of the study room and greeted him. She was wearing the school uniform of Minegahara High School, which made him feel very nostalgic. This girl, who wore the school uniform properly and looked like a top student was Sara Himeji, the girl they had just talked about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had been studying in the study room while waiting for Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She came to his side with the footsteps of a clingy cat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m going to trouble you from today, Azusagawa-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She folded her hands and made a respectful salute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She addressed him formally after she realized that the principal was also there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Welcome, Himeji&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a rare thing not to have to introduce oneself when admitting new students. Also, Minegahara High School, where Sara was studying, was Sakuta&#39;s alma mater, so he basically knew her academic progress. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Furthermore, Sakuta even knew exactly the type of questions on the midterm and final exams. After all, until last year, he had been studying there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Just follow the procedure next, Azusagawa.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After hearing Sakuta&#39;s answer, the principal went back to his office. All the while mumbling things like &quot;I have to submit materials to the manager next, and I have to sort out the papers......ouch I&#39;m so busy......&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta stopped looking at the principal&#39;s back and turned his head back, and found Sara looking at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you for being my lecturer&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The four eyes met and Sara thanked him again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s okay, it&#39;s my turn to thank you. Thank you for naming me and making my salary higher.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please make my grades higher too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her face looked like she was pouting. Needless to say she was very clever, and she cooperated when Sakuta made such jokes. He looked at her and couldn&#39;t help but think of the dream he had a few days ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That dream was so clear and realistic that it didn&#39;t even feel like a dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dream, Sara had become his student on December 1.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And today, it really is December 1st.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The principal called him and told him that he had a new student, and then Sara came out of the study room and greeted herself......It was all the same as the dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost like replaying a video tape. Sakuta had repeated the same day several times with Tomoe Koga in her sophomore year of high school, and what he was feeling now is somewhat similar to that. The difference is that this time it was much shorter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#39;t know what kind of phenomenon this was, and his need for answers overpowered his astonishment. It was as if he didn&#39;t know where to go, and kept wandering in his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It made him feel a little unsettled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; At that time, it felt so real, but it was a dream, so could it be a dream now too? This possibility exists. Because there is almost no gap between dreams and reality......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, Sakuta-sensei?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked a bit puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you have nothing to say to me, can you stop staring at me like that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked confused and covered her face with her hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta turned his eyes to the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello, teacher.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He saw Kento Yamada walk in and greeted him with a breathless greeting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello, Sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri Yoshikazu followed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento and Juri were both students of Sakuta, who taught them mathematics. Both were students at Minegahara High School, the same grade as Sara. I remember Kento saying that he and Sara were still in the same class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You two are here together, that&#39;s good, I have something......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was about to tell them about Sara&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I just happened to be on the same elevator as him.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Juri suddenly and inexplicably corrected him. Sakuta didn&#39;t know what to say to that, so he nodded his head a couple of times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;From today onwards, Himeji-san will be coming to my class as well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada-san and Yoshikazu-san, please take care of her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really? Are you serious?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento acted surprised. Of course, it wasn&#39;t out of disgust. Kento had good feelings about Sara, and he was naturally happy that Sara was coming to class. But his surprise showed that he wasn&#39;t mentally prepared for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada-san, what do you mean by this question?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara threw out the question without any pretense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you mean? What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you happy and surprised, or are you dissatisfied with me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento tried to play dumb, but Sara immediately asked a follow-up question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Surprised is surprised, what else can it mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento turned his face back and looked coy. Sara covered her mouth with her hands and laughed at this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri ignored them and walked past them to the study room where the next class was to be held.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, let&#39;s get to class. It&#39;s already time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento said to Sakuta, blushing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve seen you so active.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento ignored Sakuta&rsquo;s teasing and followed Juri as if she were running away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This was too obvious. His reaction was the same as what Sakuta had seen in his dream a few days ago. Juri&#39;s indifferent behavior was also the same as in the dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem was getting worse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If this had happened to Sakuta alone, and only this once, then Sakuta could have laughed it off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta knew that was not the case.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a rumor recently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On SNS, it was about a dream with the tag &#39;#dreaming&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Legend has it that such dreams come true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thought it was just a supernatural gimmick until he found out that Akagi Ikumi was using &quot;#dreaming&quot; to play a partner of justice. He witnessed the moment when the dream came true. The dream that appeared on &quot;#Dreaming&quot; became reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I saw it with my own eyes, so I had to believe it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are still hundreds of posts with the tag &quot;#dreaming&quot; on SNS every day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people write about what they dreamed last night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Some people write about their dreams coming true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are more and more of these posts every day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, there are those who deny this phenomenon, saying that it is impossible and is a joke. Some have even started a debate about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe this is some kind of precursor. Or maybe something is already happening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta can no longer pretend that it&#39;s not a problem now that he&#39;s in the party.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The biggest reason was that he knew who the situation was about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To most people, she was a well-known Internet singer who often recorded songs and posted them on video sites.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But to him, she is an enigmatic mini-skirt Santa Claus, and one that only he can see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta must see Touko again and ask her something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a must. Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;go to Kirishima Touko</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Mai is in danger</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because Sakuta, who was born in another world of possibilities and was even better, sent this message to Sakuta in this world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Seeing such a message, it was impossible for him to remain indifferent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He had to know what it meant no matter what.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But it was impossible to worry about this now, and it was impossible to see Touko immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was now in a training facility, so the only thing he could do was to teach Kento, Juri, and Sara math.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s almost time for class, so let&#39;s get started.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said to Sara, who was still standing in front of the office.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. Thank you for your help from now on, Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The final exams at Minegahara High School are tomorrow.

Sakuta was going to teach them how to deal with trigonometry now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the eighty-minute class, Sakuta sent the students off with a quick &quot;Good luck on the final exam!&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, can you not say such bad things?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento said with a reluctant face and walked out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juri gave a silent salute and walked out as well, and Sakuta couldn&#39;t tell if she was saying &#39;Yes&#39; or &#39;No&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to take some time to gain the trust and respect of the students.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll do my best.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was the only one who thoughtfully responded with such kind words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had left her alone today so that she could discuss her future class schedule and guidelines with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, my plan is to help you with the wrong questions after the exam......Do you have any plans for the future classes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t make it too clear. But Sara is very smart, she must be able to understand what he meant beyond the words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What was being said in class was too shallow for Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The lessons Sakuta had arranged for Kento and Juri applied to improving basic knowledge. But Sara had already mastered that knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m sure I can&#39;t give her the exact same content in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara thought for a moment, then looked up into Sakuta&#39;s eyes and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I wait until after the final exams to make a decision?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It would be a shame if I said something big now and only got a thirty on the final exam.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t make such a joke in front of Yamada-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;During the midterm exam, Kento really got a 30 on the exam. It was because Sara had read his answer sheet that she said &quot;thirty points&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t tell Yamada-san that I made a joke about him. It&#39;s a secret between us&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara showed a happy smile. Maybe it&#39;s because I understood who she was joking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you&#39;ll be with Yamada and Yoshikazu in class next time?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. We have to answer the exam questions, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The answer sheets may not be out yet, so bring them with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. Please discuss your future plans with me then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. Be careful on your way back then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara picked up her bag, but hesitated to move. She looked up at Sakuta, as if waiting for him to say something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to tell me &#39;Good luck on the final exam!&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I expect you to get a high score.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s not encouragement, that&#39;s pressure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her tone was full of disgust, but her face was a cheerful smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After sending Sara off, Sakuta went back to his office and compiled a report on today&#39;s lesson. With one more student, the amount of content to write naturally became more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After doing what he had to do, Sakuta started looking for Rio Futaba, who was also working here. I thought I would leave work with her after class, and ask her on the way how dreams become reality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He soon spotted Rio&#39;s back. She was in the break area connected to the office, answering questions for a tall boy. The boy was Toranosuke Kasai, and Rio was teaching him physics.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke was listening to the lecture, pointing his finger at the textbook and writing notes in his notebook. Whenever Rio asked him, &quot;Did you understand what was said?&quot; he would whisper back, &quot;Yes, I understand.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The small voice contrasted with his tall height. After Rio finished explaining one question, she started to explain the next one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It looks like it will take a while.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The matter of dreams becoming reality is not too urgent. It&#39;s okay to ask next time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The most important thing for Sakuta was the information that &#39;Mai is in danger&#39;. Sakuta talked to Rio about it the day she received the message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, Sakuta borrowed Mai-san&#39;s cell phone and contacted Rio, making an appointment to meet her at Fujisawa Station after school. After the meeting, the two went to Sakuta&#39;s other part-time workplace, the family restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are only two possibilities for &quot;now&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio came back from the coffee buffet and calmly analyzed it for Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Which two?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;One is that Kirishima Touko herself will directly harm Mai-san.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And the other?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Someone who suffers from puberty syndrome because of Kirishima Touko will harm Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There are really only two possibilities.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The information we got was only two sentences long, so we could only deduce a general direction from it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no mention of what will happen next or what dangers there will be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I can only understand that it is related to Touko Kirishima at this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a direct attack.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That would be a real crime. Sakuta thought that there was no reason for her to do so. At the same time, he had not felt that she had such an intention when she had met her. Since she was a transparent person, she had already had many opportunities to do so. And the fact that nothing had happened to Mai so far proved that Sakuta was right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I also think the latter is more likely.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio said as she took a sip of coffee. What she meant was that she couldn&#39;t completely deny the possibility of the former.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was more concerned about the fact that she had said earlier that Mai was &#39;someone who was in the way&#39;. But that comment also seemed to be motivated by the situation. It didn&#39;t contain too strong feelings, not the kind of feelings that would commit a crime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you think I should do in this situation?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After waiting for Rio to put down her coffee cup, Sakuta sincerely sought her advice. There was simply too little information now to take concrete measures.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If we want to eradicate the problem, wouldn&#39;t it be enough to cure Kirishima Touko of her puberty syndrome?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Only Sakuta could see her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This symptom was very similar to the previous Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s what you&#39;re good at&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio was smiling here, most likely because she remembered that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Remembering the moment when Sakuta confessed to Mai back in high school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, Sakuta ran to the playground in the middle of an exam figure, shouted out Mai&#39;s name, and said &#39;I love you&#39;. The whole school heard it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have to ask you if I could solve it like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, Mai and Touko were not the same. Both of them had different relationships with Sakuta, were in different situations and had different conditions......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, Rio made an assumption about the reason for Mai&#39;s disappearance. But now, they knew nothing about Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Why would only Sakuta be able to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although at first glance the symptoms were similar to Mai&#39;s, there was clearly something different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Touko is just invisible to everyone, and everyone still remembers her existence. Mai, on the other hand, simply disappeared from people&#39;s memories at the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are still a lot of people who go back and listen to the songs she uploaded to the video website and comment, &quot;I think Kirishima Touko&#39;s songs are great, right? I really like Kirishima&#39;s songs so much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you think that the cause of the recent puberty syndrome is all due to Kirishima Touko?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko said &quot;Gave them a gift.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Gave it to Hirokawa Uzuki to make her suddenly become observant......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Gave it to Akagi Ikumi so she could exchange identities with her other-worldly self......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said she also gave out many gifts......to those students who saw the future in their dreams. What she gave out was all those people wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Didn&#39;t she say so herself?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was because of such a prerequisite that Rio proposed that the root of the problem be solved by treating Kirishima Touko&#39;s puberty syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Those were just her own words.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So there is no way to prove her authenticity. Sakuta would not have an answer even after hours of discussion with Rio here. There was no more room for argument.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In the end, you&#39;re still right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta realized that having walked into a dead end, finally came to a conclusion and chose to accept it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It seems the only way to cure Kirishima Touko&#39;s adolescent syndrome&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio agreed with her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you want to read more tweets labeled &#39;#dreaming&#39;? Although it may only have a psychological effect, it does not exclude the possibility of being able to foresee the future&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, adolescent syndrome for adolescent syndrome, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That day, when Sakuta returned home, he followed Rio&#39;s advice and immediately borrowed a laptop from her sister, Kaede, and searched for &quot;Mai Sakurajima&quot; with the &quot;#dreaming&quot; tag. But I didn&#39;t find anything related to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But I didn&#39;t find any article related to &quot;Mai is in danger&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;From that day until now, Sakuta searched for &quot;#dreaming&quot; every day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It took about ten minutes for him to walk home from Fujisawa Station. It was already past nine o&#39;clock in the evening when he arrived home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m home&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After entering the door and taking off his shoes, Nasuno, the family cat, came running straight to him. Then, the door to the bathroom opened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re back, brother&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s sister, Kaede, came out of the washroom in her pajamas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She wiped her hair, which was still wet, with a towel while walking to the kitchen. The sound of opening the refrigerator door came from the kitchen, and it seemed that she was preparing that ice cream to come out to eat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta went into the washroom, washed his hands and rinsed his mouth, and then returned to the living room with a little anticipation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;First, to see if there were any phone messages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now, Sakuta was especially looking forward to having someone call him. From the bottom of his heart, he was looking forward to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the red light on the telephone was always on. If someone left a message for himself, this red light would flash. Then he looked at the caller log again, and it turned out that no one had called either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s call again&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He pressed the eleven digits he had recently memorized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the number the miniskirt Santa had told him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After a moment&#39;s wait, a waiting tone came on the line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This meant that the number was not an empty number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If Kirishima Touko is not lying, then this should be her cell phone number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the seventh ring, a very mechanical &quot;Please leave a message if you are not in&quot; tone came from the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had called Kirishima Touko many times. Yesterday he also called and left a message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the other party has not returned the call so far. But he didn&#39;t give up and still left a message for her today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this the phone number of Touko Kirishima? This is Sakuta Azusagawa. I was hoping you could tell me how to become Santa Claus. Please call me back when you have time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta put down the receiver after she finished.

It didn&#39;t look familiar at first glance, but Sakuta did recognize the number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta picked up the receiver and picked up the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Hello, this is Azusagawa&#39;s house.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The same opening as usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The other party didn&#39;t say anything right away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta could sense that someone was on the other end of the line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re Kirishima, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The number on the caller ID already proved it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t think you were so smart.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing she said was a compliment that didn&#39;t sound like a compliment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta what she meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had shown Sakuta her phone number in a surprise attack, giving her only three seconds to do so. But Sakuta had memorized that number. Her remark was undoubtedly sarcastic about the incident.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;People often compliment me like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;and, moreover, very cunning.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Was that a comment on Sakuta&#39;s act of playing dumb just now?

Maybe it&#39;s a dig at both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But at the same time, not very good at thinking&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t know why, but her rating is getting lower and lower. No, actually it wasn&#39;t high from the beginning. It feels like the high rating is just because of the word &quot;smart&quot;. But the way she used it was not a compliment at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No one answered all those calls, so any normal person would know they were being avoided, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think I can keep calling as long as you haven&#39;t pulled the plug on me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had a reason why she couldn&#39;t back down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Go find Kirishima Touko</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Mai is in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of his other self, he wanted to convey this message to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have something to ask you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not going to tell you how to become Santa Claus.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can you come out and meet me again?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t think that one phone call would give her the answers she needed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Too many things were still unclear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;His other self had asked herself to find Touko.

Because she knew about it too. But Sakuta didn&#39;t think she would forgive himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, it&#39;s better to go to bed early today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I need to make sure I have enough energy to prepare for tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To prepare for the coming punishment......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;3</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll cancel today&#39;s schedule then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The next day, Sakuta sat in the passenger seat and listened to Mai&#39;s reply.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The car stopped at a red light. There was no engine sound inside the car, it was quiet. Mai and Sakuta were going to their second class now, and they were the only ones in the car. Usually Nodoka always gags in the car, but today she had a first period class and had already left for school before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s leave the date for another time&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai let go of the steering wheel with one hand and tossed her hair that was sliding down her shoulder back behind her back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey~&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why do you look so upset when you&#39;ve arranged something else for yourself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was looking forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s what I wanted to say.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The green light came on. Mai stepped on the gas pedal as hard as if she were stepping on Sakuta&#39;s foot. The car took off with a jolt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Mai-san, why don&#39;t you act a little more disappointed?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I&#39;m disappointed.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai gave him a hateful sideways glance. The first time Sakuta saw her this morning, he knew that she had put on more makeup than usual today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve ruined all my elaborate dates.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her costume should have been carefully prepared for the birthday date as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The wide gray pants with pleats on the midline had a fresh look. The waist was tied tightly like a pocket, which emphasized her figure. The white shirt on the top half of the body has a simple kind of beauty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">When I saw Mai today, my first impression was beautiful and stylish rather than cute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The black coat she wore outdoors was now lying on the back seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I&#39;m happy to be with such a beautiful you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not happy at all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta looked like she had been hit with a stiff counter-punch.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He thought it would be better if she didn&#39;t talk too much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But it can&#39;t be helped.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was not only about Sakuta, she was even a party to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why she agreed to cancel the birthday date. She didn&#39;t get angry, she just said &#39;okay&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing this from her, Sakuta could say that a big stone had fallen from his heart. But at the same time, Sakuta also felt an even stronger anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai should also feel uneasy after receiving a warning like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that the other Sakuta had deliberately delivered such a message meant that this danger was not an everyday danger like tripping over a stone and falling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There must be a greater danger approaching Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Mai had experienced the worst. On that snowy day. As soon as they received the message &quot;Mai is in danger&quot;, that bad memory came back to his mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although it was not a personal experience, there was a clear memory in his head. The night before Christmas. The despair that he felt when the pure white snow was dyed bright red was still vivid in his mind. Although he had never wanted to forget, the pain is something Sakuta can never forget.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And this should be the same for Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But she didn&#39;t show any such signs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You have me to thank for being a reasonable girlfriend&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t want to thank anyone because the time I spend with you has become less.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then why don&#39;t I come with you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I can&#39;t do that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s tone became a little stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t think that Kirishima Touko would directly harm Mai. But he was still wary of her. This thorny feeling was subconsciously spilled out with her words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta felt like he had screwed up, but it was too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The two were still able to talk and laugh like they usually did, all because Mai had taken Sakuta&#39;s feelings into consideration at every turn. But now Sakuta had ruined the mood with that one comment. The atmosphere instantly became tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta couldn&#39;t even make up a word to make up for the situation, so she looked out of the car window at the rear view mirror in embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai &nbsp;laughed softly at this and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You don&#39;t have to be so nervous.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How can I not be nervous?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know you&#39;re worried about me.&quot;, Mai said, while glancing at the Christmas advertisement in the window of the convenience store on the side of the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, it&#39;s almost Christmas.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta really wanted to hide everything from Mai. It was true that he could have been more calm if it wasn&#39;t the current season.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But he remembered all that, so whenever Christmas approached, Sakuta&#39;s heart always unsettled. Whenever the streets were colored with red and green neon lights in the colors of Christmas, He would feel an inexpressible feeling of emptiness and anxiety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll try to be with you this month.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I want to be with you from morning to night this time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly, Sakuta wanted her to stay at home and not go outside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Mai was in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Until Sakuta finds out the meaning of that statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He never wanted to lose Mai again. That kind of pain, it was unbearable ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But it was unrealistic to keep her at home. She had to go to college and work. If a national artist disappeared, there would be bad press. If that happened, Mai would be in real danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that enough for a while?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After this time, I want to be with you from night to morning too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re still in the mood for jokes, that means you&#39;re fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t you feel scared?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not afraid with you around.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai said something that made his heart flutter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai-san, I have something to tell you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you see a convenience store again later, can you stop the car?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you doing there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let me give you a good hug.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;You have to wear a seatbelt when you&#39;re on the road. It&#39;s a pain in the ass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t come.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai laughed happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The anxiety in Sakuta&#39;s heart faded just by staying by Mai&#39;s side. Not that all the anxiety was gone, but he couldn&#39;t just show weakness. Still less could he keep relying on Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I must see Touko today and ask her everything I need to ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, you originally said you wanted to take me somewhere. Where were you planning to go?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;ll know when you go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you taking me to the wedding venue?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you&#39;re going to meet your mother-in-law?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;ve already met her before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai responded to Sakuta while looking up at the road sign. Then the car drove under the blue and white sign. Then, as if she suddenly thought of something, Mai suddenly changed the subject and asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta, what is your second class?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Basic Seminar&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have enough attendance?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not as busy as you are.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have enough attendance too, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Up ahead is the Sekiya Junction. It&#39;s not really a highway entrance or a traffic hub, but a lot of roads intersecting here, so it looks like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai hit the directional indicator here and turned the wheel to the left. If you want to go to the university, then you should go straight up to the 4th ring road here. It wasn&#39;t the first time that Sakuta took Mai&#39;s car to school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was rightly confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai didn&#39;t answer. She just drove silently, heading for an unfamiliar road. The car drove onto National Highway 1. After driving for a while, it arrived at the Totsuka toll station. The car passed the toll booth and drove on the high</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The sign said Yokohama.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the road signs were the names of places in the direction of Yokohama. Sakuta and Mai&#39;s university is in Kanazawa Hakkei. Although it was also in Yokohama, it was not in the same direction as &quot;Yokohama&quot; which was near Yokohama Station on the sign. The distance between the two of them was not short, and it takes twenty minutes by train.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this a way to skip school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai would come to school on days when she could, even if it was short. It&#39;s unusual for her to skip school. No, it was probably the first time Sakuta had ever seen her skip school so openly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s my birthday. I don&#39;t mind making an exception&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai had her hand on the steering wheel and a smile on her side face. It took Sakuta thirty minutes to realize what her smile really meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She finally pulled into the underground parking lot of a super high-rise building that was a landmark. This looming tower had always been the landmark of Yokohama.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, Sakuta already sensed that something was not quite right. No, to be precise, something was very wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai-san, what are you doing here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;ll see when you get there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The two of them got out of the car and walked into the elevator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai pressed the button for the third floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The elevator bell rang and the doors opened to reveal a vast shopping mall in front of Sakuta and Mai. It gave a sense of freedom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The entire mall was loosely arranged with plenty of space. It was incredible how it made even people walking through the mall look a little more leisurely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Here we are&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai stopped in front of a store. Even in such an upscale mall, this store looked especially luxurious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The letters of the store name were recognizable to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a world-famous jewelry chain, the impression of the color is light blue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I remember that there was a movie named after it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at the store and was struck by a sense of wonder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Today is my 20th anniversary. Shouldn&#39;t you, the boyfriend, show it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... should&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, you should. So Sakuta had no choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta subconsciously tried to deny it the next second. It was almost as if it was a defensive instinct.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai asked with a cute expression. She tilted her head slightly and looked at Sakuta&#39;s face......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s too cheeky. Sakuta couldn&#39;t retreat from this ungodly expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I count it as a Christmas present?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the best I could do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s the most disgusting thing my mother ever said to me when I was a kid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai&#39;s face was smiling even though she said she hated it so much. She walked into the store alone, and Sakuta was left outside with the opposite expression on her face, not to mention how miserable she was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess I&#39;ll just have to be prepared to bleed out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Fortunately, I took out my salary yesterday to prepare for the date ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thanked himself for yesterday while following Mai inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He took the first monumental step towards the store.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just one step into the store and the atmosphere felt completely different. Even the smell around was different. It even felt different to the touch of the soles on his feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The atmosphere inside the store was elegant, with only a few display cases. With the size of this store, in fact, it is possible to put down more goods, but the store did not do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This store is very extravagant in its use of space. So naturally, it was impossible for Sakuta to hide behind the shelves to avoid the eyes of the store staff. Besides him and Mai, there was only one other couple in the store, so it was impossible to hide from the crowd. Even the store clerks outnumbered the customers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So, as soon as they entered the store.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Welcome&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;An older lady who looked calm came up to greet them, looking about twenty-five years old. She approached Sakuta and Mai with a smile on her face. But she didn&#39;t manage to keep her business-like smile to the end.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But she didn&#39;t keep that perfect business smile until the end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;May I ask if you two are here to see......today?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was interrupted by shock in the middle of her sentence. Although she was not quite ready to scream out, the shape of her mouth made it clear that the scream was close to her lips.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason was simple. It was because &#12302;Sakurajima Mai&#12303; had suddenly appeared in front of her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But she quickly regained her smile and said &#12302;Excuse me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If it&#39;s convenient, please move to the table inside.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The older woman said to Sakuta and Mai in a lowered voice so that the other couple wouldn&#39;t hear her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry to interrupt your business. Let&#39;s do as you say.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai agreed with the older lady&#39;s suggestion in a businesslike manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta felt that the further she went in, the more of a guest place she became, and it shouldn&#39;t be an illusion. There was no part of the store that made Sakuta feel at ease.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s get out of here. Or we&#39;ll disturb the other customers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai took Sakuta&#39;s arm and pulled her along after the older lady.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This way, please.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When Sakuta arrived, he found that this wasn&#39;t a table at all. It was a private room. Of course, the private room did have tables, so the older lady wasn&#39;t wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The seats were the kind of sofas that didn&#39;t sink too deep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta sat side-by-side with Mai as the lady had arranged.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The lady made an introduction of herself and said that she would serve the two today. Saukta felt that she was so attentive to service that she really made people embarrassed to walk out of the store without spending some money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have a good style in mind?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The older woman asked Mai first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Mai glanced at Sakuta, and she turned her face to him with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Today is Mai&#39;s birthday. She turns twenty today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;May I send my best congratulations.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai nodded at her in appreciation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d like to give her a present as a souvenir.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The older lady nodded at that. This made Sakuta shudder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is there anything that a college student can afford on a part-time salary?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta chose to ask the most important question first. Because there was no way to get past it. Sakuta had just seen how expensive all the items on display in the cabinet were ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find one you like. Do you want me to introduce you to some of them?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d be grateful if you would.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay, just a moment.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The lady bowed and walked out of the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When the door closed, Sakuta was finally able to lean his back against the backrest of the sofa without worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta couldn&#39;t help but sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the next second, there was a knock on the door. Immediately afterwards, another female clerk came in and said, &quot;Sorry to interrupt. Sakuta immediately straightened his back and said goodbye to the sofa back in less than two seconds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please help yourself&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The clerk placed two steaming cups of tea in front of Sakuta and Mai. The liquid in the cups was clear and transparent, the color of freshly burned bricks. I could smell the aroma even when it was still on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai thanked, and then the clerk said, &quot;Enjoy,&quot; and walked out with a salute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just as she left, the older lady came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was carrying two trays.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve kept you waiting,&quot; she said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To be honest, it wasn&#39;t much of a wait at all. Sakuta even wished she had waited a little longer so he could have time to prepare himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Without moving, the lady moved the cups aside and set the first tray between Sakuta and Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the tray was a small box that looked like gray felt, and inside were three kinds of necklaces. One was hanging from a heart-shaped pendant. One was wearing a ring. One with a four-leaf clover pendant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai picked up one of them and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve worn this one before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The necklace she picked up was the one with the four-leaf clover pendant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is the one you wore in the movie last year. Many customers come to our store to buy this one after watching the movie.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, the lady put another tray on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On this tray were three rings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;One was two leaves twisted into a ring shape. One was two rings crossed together. One was in the shape of a heart, which matched exactly with the heart-shaped necklace just now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Each piece of jewelry shone with a beautiful silver glow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can try them on at your leisure&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai chose the heart-shaped ring first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was placed on her right ring finger and fit perfectly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai looked at her finger with a natural smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How does it look?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She lifted her hand to Sakuta&#39;s eyes with a satisfied look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The heart-shaped ring matched her long, slender fingers perfectly. It was like a part of her body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It suits you&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the only answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It really suits you&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After waiting for Sakuta to finish his speech, the lady began to make various recommendations to Mai. But Sakuta didn&#39;t care to listen to any of these words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s eyes fixed on the tiny price tags.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The price of these jewels was a little more gentle than Sakuta had imagined out of thin air. Indeed, they were at a price Sakuta could afford with his part-time salary.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is there a style you would like to see here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The older sister looked at Mai, who looked at Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This was a gift from Sakuta to Mai, so Mai wanted Sakuta to pick it out. To be more precise, the look in her eyes now was ordering Sakuta to help her pick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think both heart shaped ones are pretty good&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A heart-shaped necklace and a heart-shaped ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta put the two pieces he picked out into the same tray. Then put the rest on another tray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the right is the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the left was the necklace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Choose one of the two. Simple and straightforward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Just waiting for Sakuta to make a choice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another glance at the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Shiny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another glance at the necklace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Shiny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Price wise, the ring is about 10,000 yen more expensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Take a small deep breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And then a big deep breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And finally...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll take this one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta pointed to one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I look forward to seeing you again.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Mai walked out of the store and bowed to the older lady who came out to see them off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then they walked together to the elevator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The two of them naturally held hands. At this time, Mai had a cute heart-shaped silver ring on her right ring finger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The store had just the right size, so they didn&#39;t ask for a package and came out wearing it directly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did you hear that? I&#39;m looking forward to seeing you again&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai looked at the side of Sakuta&#39;s face and said half-jokingly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Next time, come and buy a wedding ring.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt and try to look forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I&#39;m afraid the cost will be a single digit more. I&#39;ll have to be prepared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, Mai.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Happy birthday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Always half a day late in saying these things.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then next year I&#39;d like to say it to you in person just as the page turns.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That depends on my work schedule.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai said that and tightened her right hand, which was holding Sakuta, a little harder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;4</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai and Sakuta took a detour to Yokohama, so by the time they got to the university, there were only about 20 minutes left in the lunch break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this time there were more empty seats in the cafeteria. Many students were just passing the time here after eating their meals. This is a daily sight in the university.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta ordered Soba noodles in soup. It was quick to serve and quick to eat. And the price is less than three hundred yen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He had just hemorrhaged money today. This lunch is good for the stomach and the wallet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although hemorrhaging money, Sakuta is not a bit regretful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because on the way to the university, every time Mai stopped at a red light, she would look at her right ring finger and smile happily at the same time......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Mai had been dating for more than two and a half years and had never seen such a happy expression on her face. At that time, her face showed the real feelings that she couldn&#39;t suppress.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta even regretted it a little. Why hadn&#39;t he given her the ring sooner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He found an empty table and sat down, and then Mai came over after settling the bill. She ordered the fried soba, which was a bit more sophisticated than his..</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as she sat down, she gave Sakuta her bowl of fried soba.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you for the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you want to thank me, why don&#39;t you just put it in my mouth?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai ignored Sakuta&#39;s complaints and ate her own soba.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t long before the third class was about to start. So Sakuta also ate the fried soba. There was a crunching sound when I bit into it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Mai finished eating before the end of the lunch break. They didn&#39;t talk while they ate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Eat a bowl of noodles and then drink the noodle soup. The aroma of bonito soup poured deep into the nose. At the same time, he felt the sweetness of soy sauce in my mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, someone called Sakuta&#39;s name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta put down his bowl and looked up. He saw Akagi Ikumi standing across the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When she saw Mai next to him, she bowed to Mai and then looked at Sakuta with an apologetic face and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry. It didn&#39;t work today either.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said this while spreading her palm to show Sakuta and Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Four days ago, there was a message from another world of possibility written on her palm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, Sakuta made a request to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was to ask Ikumi of that world about the meaning of those messages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Why was Mai in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Why did she have to go to Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To understand these two points, most of hsi problems would be solved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with Sakuta in that world, at least Sakuta in this world has found Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And there was an appointment to meet today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that ...... Ikumi asks questions every day, but never gets a response. And Ikumi is a serious natured person, so she comes to report to Sakuta every day. Every day her</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;expression was the same as now, looking guilty ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think I got the message I wrote over there. I haven&#39;t felt connected to the other me since I received that message ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is the best for you&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The absence of it means that Ikumi&#39;s adolescent syndrome is completely cured.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ikumi opened her mouth with a serious face. Sakuta knew what she wanted to say, so he blocked her way without waiting for her to say it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You don&#39;t want to swap with the you of that world again with your sense of responsibility. I don&#39;t want to make you sick again.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... Okay. I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ikumi&#39;s expression soothed for a moment, and it seemed that she had somehow understood Sakuta&#39;s joke. But I don&#39;t know how much she actually understood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, Akagi Ikumi is a person who is too kind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She brought these two messages to Sakuta, and she must have felt she had to take responsibility for them. And that thought must have been far stronger than Sakuta had imagined.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was just the way she was. Just the other day, Sakuta had just experienced firsthand how serious she was. That was why it was important not to take this lightly. Ikumi&#39;s words like &quot;okay&quot; and &quot;no problem&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ll let you know as soon as I have any information.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ikumi said and then saluted Mai again, and then turned to leave. Saki Kamisato was waiting for her in front of the cafeteria. They chatted and walked together to the school building. It seems that even with the change of person, she and Saki are still friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is probably a good thing for Ikumi. But not necessarily for Sakuta, because every time they meet Saki glares at Sakuta with displeasure......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The preparatory bell rang. Five minutes to go before class starts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The students who were chatting in the cafeteria were moving one by one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Mai also returned their cutlery and walked up to the main school building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai, are you home tonight?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;At your house&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You love me so much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nodoka said she would buy a cake when she came back and eat it with Kaede.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai showed the chat log on her phone to Sakuta. Nodoka gloated when she found out that Sakuta and Mai&#39;s date was canceled. Sakuta thought to himself that he would be punished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She asked me if I needed to prepare your share.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Please tell her I&#39;m sure I want it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;All right. Be careful, then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You should be more careful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Indeed, you&#39;ll cry if something happens to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Satisfied with Sakuta&#39;s answer, Mai waved her right hand with the ring on it at Sakuta and walked into the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai is so cute today&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta savored the joy as he walked to the classroom on the third floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Going to see Santa Claus after class......in order to keep this kind of life in the future as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;5</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The fourth period of the basic seminar ended early. It was ten minutes before the bell rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although a little early, but today this crap class will be here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The professor put away the textbook and walked out of the classroom unhurriedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course the students didn&#39;t have a problem with the early dismissal. The students began to chat with their friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, let&#39;s go too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s friend Takumi Fukuyama was also in this class. He came over to call Sakuta all the way from school. He gathered his stationery early and stood up with his school bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry, I&#39;m busy today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You actually have a date. I&#39;m so jealous. Have fun then. I&#39;ll leave now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After expressing all kinds of emotions in one breath, Takumi withdrew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Good spirit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said this to himself. At that moment, another student came up to talk to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hola, Azusagawa-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mito Miori, who was studying in the International Business School, greeted him in Spanish. Sakuta is in the School of Statistical Science and is not with her. However, they both took Spanish as a second language, and they were in the same class for the basic seminar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mito, are you alone today?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She usually goes to this class with her girlfriends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Manami and her friends skipped class to play.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Just the girls?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;They called the boys.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The guys we met in the sorority? You were the only one who got lost and didn&#39;t make it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She sounded a little angry. I guess she was excluded by her friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Well, then, congratulations.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re a pain in the ass.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She glared at Sakuta and accused him. She also took out her frustration with her best friend on Sakuta. But she was inexplicably likeable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, think about it, if you go, it will be you again. Wouldn&#39;t that make your girlfriends jealous again?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m an obnoxious woman.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t tell if she&#39;s joking or serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the fact that she said that means she at least knows that people around her see her that way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, I just saw Mai-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori suddenly changed the subject and leaned out to say so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So I saw her. We go to the same university, it&#39;s normal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was in the same classroom with her in the third period of basic English. She was wearing a shiny thing on her hand, I saw it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She teased Sakuta in a joking tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That was your birthday present for her, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why don&#39;t you ask her yourself?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She had an aura of happiness all over her body. I was too embarrassed to ask.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori looked up at the ceiling with an enchanted look on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her reaction surprised Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was hard for him to imagine that someone like Miori would have special feelings for the ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, Sakuta was not wrong to think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori&#39;s next words revealed her true thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I would also like to give a ring to Mai-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be the one to receive the ring?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not like anyone would give me a ring right now. And even if someone did, I wouldn&#39;t be too happy about it, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori seemed to think that it was logical, but Sakuta felt like she didn&#39;t understand it. He had a good idea of what she was trying to say. To put it simply, it meant that a gift had to be consensual. The ring itself wasn&#39;t that important. What Miori meant was that she hadn&#39;t liked anyone enough to want a ring from them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, my birthday is on&ndash;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You attract butterflies because you love to say things like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta interrupted her, pointing this out to her with precision by the way. The thing to do as his plastic friend was to tell the truth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll only say these things to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You attract butterflies because you love to say such things.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I just say one thing and then another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then what should I say to boys?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him with a pout, making him look like the bad guy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Like, &#39;It&#39;s a nice day,&#39; or something like that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Talking about that is fun?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s point was to make her say more meaningless things. But Mito didn&#39;t get it at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, the bell for the fourth period finally rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve got fifth period, so I&#39;m going to leave now, Ciao.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mito walked out of the classroom with her handbag and waved at Sakuta before she left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t wait for her to go far before she picked up her bag and prepared to go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The bell rang, so there was no more dawdling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He had made an appointment with Touko to contact her after class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Few students had a fifth period class like Miori. Now that fourth period was over, the campus was filled with an after-school feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Some students went to club activities, others hurriedly rushed to their part-time jobs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As Sakuta stepped out of the main school building, he saw a steady stream of students walking down the boulevard toward the main entrance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta broke away from the crowds alone and went to the public address booth located next to the clock tower.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He had never seen anyone other than himself use this booth. It was essentially a booth for Sakuta alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He picked up the handset and dropped the change he had prepared into the phone. The remaining ten-dollar coin was placed on the top of the phone as a backup. Then he dialed the eleven-digit number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The phone rang once and was picked up immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was really fast. Sakuta thought she might be on her cell phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is Azusagawa. I had an appointment with you yesterday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting for you at the main gate.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She hung up the phone after that short sentence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta took the unused ten yen coin back into his bag and walked out of the phone booth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He followed her instructions and walked quickly across the boulevard towards the main gate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Within a few steps, he could see his destination through the gaps between the students walking ahead of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But there was no mini-skirt Santa Claus in sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When I walked out of the school, I didn&#39;t see Touko in a red dress either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was told to wait here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was clear that the phone call said she was waiting at the door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although it was a little unacceptable, he chose to wait on the curb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was already a girl standing by the curb.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably waiting for someone too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The girl was wearing short skirt pants, black leggings and black boots. The upper half of the body is a loose knitted shirt, with a long jacket over it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was inevitable that getting too close would cause misunderstanding. So Sakuta chose to stand five steps away from her and waited for Touko at a distance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, for some reason, the girl spoke to him instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you laughing at? It&#39;s not funny, is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At the sound of her voice, Sakuta responded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, Miss Kirishima.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta greeted her as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So Santa Claus wears normal clothes, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was expecting to see a Santa Claus and was caught completely off guard. The makeup she was wearing was not the same as when she was dressed as Santa Claus. The eyeliner was very thick before. The whole face is natural. Now the whole face is natural makeup.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re so wooden, won&#39;t your girlfriend be disappointed in you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She says she likes me every now and then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko ignored Sakuta&#39;s bragging and took a step up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She walked in the exact opposite direction of the station. She walked for about five minutes along the Keikyu line railroad towards Yokohama. Walked to the river, and then walked along the river for about five minutes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As she walked, the surrounding area became a residential area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After walking for about fifteen minutes, I entered an area with many apartments. The area was full of elegant buildings. Sakuta&#39;s subjective impression was that it was a European style. It belonged to some relatively European</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Warm territory......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In short, the landscape here is completely different from that of the university and the front of the station. If he had been blindfolded on the way over, Sakuta would have thought this was a foreign country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You live around here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She ignored Sakuta&#39;s question completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to walk ahead. Sakuta was a little worried about whether it would be a bad idea for him to walk into someone&#39;s neighbourhood as an uninvolved person. At that moment, Touko suddenly stopped in her tracks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; It was an apartment building on the corner. A cake store opened in the store area on the first floor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko found a seat in the empty open-air customer seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll have the Mont Blanc cake and Earl Grey tea.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then she ordered to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was afraid that she was in a bad mood, so he went in and ordered brownies and Earl Grey tea as she had ordered. My wallet was almost empty today as I spent too much money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta told the clerk he would eat at the outdoor seating and came out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This store&#39;s Mont Blanc cake was actually baked fresh. No wonder he didn&#39;t see any Mont Blanc in the display case when he entered the store. And the clerk said that it was best to enjoy it within two hours to ensure freshness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You like Mont Blanc?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta asked as he sat down across from Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This store&#39;s is especially good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was prepared to be ignored, but to his surprise she replied in a serious way. In other words, Kirishima Touko liked Mont Blanc. Although this information was not very meaningful, it was a small step closer to her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, the clerk brought up the Mont Blanc that Kirishima had been waiting for. The clerk placed the plate and teacups in front of Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you like Mont Blanc?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And then asked the same question as him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I heard that your Mont Blanc is very good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;From the clerk&#39;s point of view, Sakuta was probably a guy who liked desserts and was exploring the store by himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The clerk smiled at his reply and said, &quot;Enjoy your meal,&quot; before walking back to the store. During the conversation, she never noticed Touko sitting across from Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed that only Sakuta could see her. That didn&#39;t change whether she was wearing a Santa costume or a regular costume.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta pushed the Mont Blanc in front of Touko. Then he pushed the black tea and cutlery over as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko picked up her fork and folded her hands and said &#39;I&#39;ll start&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her movements were very natural. It was obvious that she did this both when she was alone and when she was with others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko began by taking a bite of the long-awaited Mont Blanc. As soon as the cake entered her mouth, a smile spread across her face. The word &#39;delicious&#39; was written on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Miss Kirishima, do you have any other inconveniences?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s inconvenient about me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;For example, without me, you can&#39;t eat the Mont Blanc here&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s adolescent syndrome, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t have any inconvenience except that I can&#39;t eat the Mont Blanc here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She replied with a firm voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What if you need to buy something?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai was having a hard time buying things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nowadays, you can buy everything online.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How do you receive the goods?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There are delivery containers. And these days, many couriers are delivering without contact.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why did you suddenly stop talking?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think reality is really unromantic. A Santa Claus who has to shop online, use a delivery cabinet and receive a delivery without contact.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m thankful for these unromantic but convenient times.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She has a point. The life now would have been a fantastic experience in the past, perhaps only in movies or novels.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you&#39;re saying you&#39;re satisfied with the status quo?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not satisfied. I still want more people to hear my songs.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta was not asking about music. Touko knew it in her heart. She was deliberately not answering the question. This was getting a little off topic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was not easy to deal with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But even if you weren&#39;t transparent, you could still do this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re transparent or not, does it? You can do it anyway.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s a good thing that she&#39;s so predictable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have any idea why you&#39;re like this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a reason why Mai disappeared from people&#39;s perceptions at that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai Sakurajima&quot; had been a child actress since she was a child, and everyone knew her. Whenever and wherever she was, Mai was exposed to the eyes of everyone. She resented this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, all the teachers and students of Minegahara High School didn&#39;t know how to get along with &quot;Mai Sakurajima&quot; as an entertainer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In a sense, the stakes were the same for both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The entire school turned a blind eye to Mai, and as a result, she became unrecognizable and disappeared from people&#39;s memories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the two points of being unseen and unrecognizable, Mai and Touko are the same. But the case of Mai was very special. So it is difficult to directly apply the experience of that time. The situation is fundamentally different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The name &#39;Toruko Kirishima&#39; is widely known, and her songs are widely praised. But she was an unidentified Internet singer. No one knows what she looks like, no one knows her age, no one knows where she&#39;s from, no one knows her shoe size, and no one knows she likes Mont Blanc cake. So she doesn&#39;t need to avoid the eyes of others, and others won&#39;t be unsure how to get along with her offline.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re like this because something&#39;s bothering you, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why she couldn&#39;t order the Mont Blanc she wanted and needed Sakuta to order it for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You want to cure me of my adolescent syndrome?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#39;t answer Sakuta&#39;s question positively. Nor did she deny it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re trying to change the subject, that means there is, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko didn&#39;t say she wasn&#39;t bothered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this for me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was still no denial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Or for someone else?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She just kept asking back. There was no change in attitude during that time. She didn&#39;t show any wavering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;For my own sake, of course.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had no choice but to follow her conversation. Maybe we could find a breakthrough in the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think my being transparent has anything to do with you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have dreams too. What I dream about becomes reality.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta didn&#39;t know when she had received the gift. He didn&#39;t even know that he had received a gift. But he does have those inexplicable and realistic dreams, where what he dreams becomes reality. Sara becoming his student was exactly the same as the scene in his dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If this dream is also adolescent syndrome, shouldn&#39;t you be the one having troubles?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I have troubles. Who told me to meet a Santa Claus that only I can see?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. I guess curing my adolescent syndrome did help you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her words were accompanied by the scent of Mont Blanc, but there wasn&#39;t a lot of emotion in them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you still going to give the others puberty syndrome?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t want strange phenomena to appear in those around him. If it still endangered Mai, then he would have to stop it from happening anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I just want to sing my song. I just want to respond to the voices of the listeners. Listeners will say &#39;This song is so good&#39;, &#39;It just speaks to my heart&#39;, &#39;I want to hear you sing more&#39; ...... So, I will sing again and again&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko looked a little puzzled, she didn&#39;t see any problem with doing that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was nothing wrong with it. She hadn&#39;t done anything wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta couldn&#39;t pretend she hadn&#39;t heard that. Touko still didn&#39;t answer his positively. But the words she spoke as if nothing had happened contained an important message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That is, you know that your songs can cause puberty syndrome in some people&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The fork she was forking Mont Blanc in her hand stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why she used to say that she was the one who made Uzuki become able to read the atmosphere. Because that was the gift she delivered through the video site, through the song.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She gave out the gift called puberty syndrome to 10 million people like this. One only has to look at the number of video plays to see that this number is by no means exaggerated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta has also seen her video.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;When will you pass out songs next?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing Sakuta&#39;s question, Touko sighed softly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be the first to tell you. I&#39;ll save myself the trouble of having the phone ringing half the time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him with confidence. With a smile on her face, she looked a little happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m working on a new song right now. It&#39;s a Christmas song. I hope I can make you listen to it on Christmas Eve&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Christmas Eve means, of course, the night before Christmas Day. 24 December. If Touko&#39;s song really does give people adolescent syndrome, then something will probably happen on that day. Or after that, something will happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Just be a good boy and wait.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is there anything to be gained by waiting?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Santa&#39;s gift will make everyone happy, won&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko didn&#39;t look like she was lying. Nor was she teasing Sakuta. She really felt that her new song would bring happiness to everyone. From her expression, she could see that she was looking forward to that day. But it didn&#39;t connect with &#12302;Mai is in danger. I can&#39;t imagine why Sakuta would want to go to Kirishima Touko either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You said everyone, so something good will happen to that high school student too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta gestured to a boy with his eyes. He was wearing a student uniform and was parking his bike in the apartment parking lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If he&#39;s a good boy, he will.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So that guy will be too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the cake store, a part-time college girl was serving coffee to a customer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If she&#39;s a good girl, she will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So would Mai-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s not a good idea to keep asking questions like this. So Sakuta said his girlfriend&#39;s name as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I felt a sudden change in Touko&#39;s eyes. But it was only for a moment. Sakuta did not have time to understand what feelings were shown. But what is certain is that her feelings at the time of hearing Mai&#39;s name produced emotion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She doesn&#39;t need it, does she? She already has everything&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Touko&#39;s tone hadn&#39;t changed at all. It was exactly the same as before. But the content was different. This was the first time that Touko had made a subjective comment about someone other than Sakuta......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You don&#39;t like Mai-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had the feeling that she was implying this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t like her before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko admitted dryly. But she was using the past tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now it&#39;s different from before?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now she&#39;s started going out with a strange boy, and that makes me feel a little better about her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That doesn&#39;t necessarily sound like a compliment. There was a bit of banter in her tone. There was no doubt that she was flirting with Sakuta. But he felt that the &#39;good feeling&#39; she was talking about was true. It was from her heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If Sakuta believed that her current feelings were true, then she should not hurt Mai. If he chose to believe it, then things would be easy, but Sakuta had to minimize the possibility of misjudgment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To confirm his thoughts, Sakuta threw out a further question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re not going to do anything to Mai-san, are you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta held back from blinking and watched carefully the reaction of Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing that came out of her mouth was confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She paused for a moment, then returned the pure question. She tilted her head slightly and looked at him. It looked like what Sakuta said was a bit overwhelming to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It means I&#39;m super fond of Mai.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta averted her eyes and leaned back in his chair. The nervousness he felt just now was gone. A big stone fell from his heart. From the way Touko had reacted, the possibility of her directly harming Mai was very unlikely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The way she looks at guys is really strange. Now that she&#39;s in show business, she should have more options.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; Touko sent the last remaining piece of Mont Blanc into her mouth. After savoring it, she downed the already cold Earl Grey tea in one gulp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She put the empty cup back into the tray.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then silently stood up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This indicated that she was no longer going to talk. But Sakuta wasn&#39;t going to let her go just like that. He had bought her something to eat, so she had to give something back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d like to ask you one last question.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What question?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How do you feel about so many people listening to your songs?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He asked as she sat down and looked directly into Touko&#39;s eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Singing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And it got a lot of listeners.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, that was the most important thing to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After talking to her so much just now, Sakuta understood this deeply. That&#39;s why he asked this question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko smiled naturally. It seemed that she wanted someone to ask her that question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nothing could be more comforting than that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him with a satisfied expression. A sense of superiority bloomed in her eyes. The smile was filled with pleasure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was an instinctive, legitimate feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was impossible for her to give up such a pleasant thing. It was impossible to find a reason to give up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her words, her feelings, her expression......everything spoke of her devotion to singing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you for your hospitality&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko seemed quite pleased with this last question from Sakuta. She waved at Sakuta and walked away happily. He sat in his seat and watched until her back was out of sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not long after, the open-air seats were lit up. It was already dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was hard to describe how he felt now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Some things were clear. And some things were more confusing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;All sorts of information and status quo were piling up in Sakuta&#39;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But at last, a big clue had come to light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the new song of Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ll have to keep an eye out for it on Christmas Eve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, let&#39;s buy a Mont Blanc and go home first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta heard that the cake was so fresh that he wanted to try it himself. I don&#39;t care what I&#39;m thinking, I&#39;ll go home and have some dessert first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Today is Mai&#39;s birthday. It was the perfect day to have a cake.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;6</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta returned to the familiar city of Fujisawa. At this point, there was still more than half an hour before the cake would be fresh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although he knew that two hours was definitely enough to get home, he felt like she was holding a time bomb until he reached Fujisawa station. It was very unsettling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What if the train was delayed? What if the train stops in the middle of an accident? Even the slightest problem in the middle of the journey could cause the train to run overtime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, the train got Sakuta to Fujisawa Station on time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;All he had to do was walk back to his apartment. Sakuta walked quickly to his house, while taking care to try not to shake the cake box too much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Safe and sound back in front of the house. The cake was safe and sound. The freshness time hadn&#39;t expired yet either. Sakuta opened the door with a sigh of relief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m home&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;While greeting the family, he took a step into the foyer. At that moment, he stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a long line of shoes. And all of them were women&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta placed his shoes at the end of the line, and then took a big step into the foyer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel someone inside. But there was no sound of talking. Instead, a female singing voice was heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although he had never heard the song, he had an impression of the voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The light rhythm was pleasant to the ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the song and the lyrics sounded a bit silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment Sakuta remembered what Touko had said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No way......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Is this the so-called Christmas song?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To confirm this, Sakuta walked quickly to the living room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re back, Sakuta&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were four people sitting in front of the TV, and only Mai turned her head to greet him.

It seems that the sweet tooth is really packed in another stomach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta bought four pieces of Mont Blanc in total. So he and Mai ate half of the last one. Then it was almost eight o&#39;clock when they cleaned up the dishes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll take Uzuki to the station.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uzuki, you&#39;re not staying at Mai&#39;s today?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m going on an expedition to Hiroshima tomorrow.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Uzuki smiled and gave a V to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So I have to go home and pack today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said as she walked with Nodoka to the entrance hall.

In that case, today&#39;s meeting with the investment could almost be said to be unproductive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta still told Mai exactly what the conversation was about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, it was clear that she was not wearing a miniskirt Santa suit today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then said that she was invited to eat Mont Blanc and drink black tea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then she said she knew she had triggered the others&#39; puberty syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And then finally that she didn&#39;t like Mai before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Have you ever done anything to her before?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No. I&#39;ve never even met her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But you risk being unilaterally envied,&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai has gained a stable position both as an actress and a model. When she was a child actress, she was already widely known. So there are people who will deny her and there are people who will be unhappy with her. Envy and jealousy are commonplace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And so it is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta pointed this out, and Mai admitted it as a matter of course. Even if she did her best to do the job at hand, people would still be hurt by it. Nodoka was the one who fell into such feelings at one point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But in your opinion, she wouldn&#39;t do anything to me directly, would she?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She did have some thoughts about Mai. But Sakuta didn&#39;t think there were any negative feelings that would lead her to commit a crime. It occurred to him that when she said she didn&#39;t like Mai, she actually had an inferiority complex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In that case, it was the second possibility that Rio had mentioned which had come to mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another point is that Touko said that the song was a Christmas song that she wanted her listeners to hear on Christmas Eve. This might indicate that she was planning to take some kind of action on Christmas Eva.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, Sakuta&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Remember to free up your time on the 24th and 25th.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s already free. To be with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be with you the whole time on these two days. I&#39;ll be with you the whole time, so you can rest assured.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Let&#39;s go to a hot spring in Hakone and relax.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t say you&#39;re coming to work all of a sudden.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ve been through this a few times so far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve already told Ryoko-san that there will be no work that day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta didn&#39;t dare let his guard down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Toyohama and Kaeda are not going to be there, are they?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nodoka was going to be in a Christmas concert, and Kaede was going to see it. She said she&#39;s going back home to spend Christmas with her parents after the concert.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sweet Bullet has a Christmas concert every year. Sakuta did hear from Nodoka about the schedule for that day as well. That way no one would come to interfere with the duo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is my Christmas present to you. Got it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s answer went without saying. Of course it&#39;s &quot;Yoo-hoo!&quot; A cheer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, that night, Sakuta Azusagawa had a strange dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c4" id="h.bqia0gyr9v4p"><span class="c5">Chapter 2: Secrets and Appointments</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">December 24th.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Today is Christmas Eve. This morning, Sakuta got up a little later than usual, and was awakened by Nasuno stomping on his face just after eight in the morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If he had a first period class in college, he would have been late at this hour. But his classes for this year had all been finished the day before. The next class would be in the new year. So Sakuta is actually on winter break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta can sleep in the warmth of his blanket. He could enjoy the temptation of a good night&#39;s sleep. No school, no part-time job. But he chose to get up anyway. This was because he had an important appointment with someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s cold&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The cold air made Sakuta shiver as he stepped out of his room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he came into the living room, he first poured cat food for Nasuuya. The cat food fell into its bowl with a clatter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then he toasted the toast in the toaster and lit the stove to fry the eggs and sausages.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He enjoyed a breakfast with fixed contents beside Nasu.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After quickly putting away the dishes, he turned on the washing machine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;While waiting, Sakuta returned to the living room and turned on the TV. He doesn&#39;t watch much TV at this time of the day, so he didn&#39;t know which station was on what. Sakuta casually changed the channel around, when Kaede came out of the room sleepily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Good morning, brother.......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What about breakfast?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I want to eat&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kaede yawned as she sat down at the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta brought her an extra portion of eggs and sausage that he had just fried by hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I want to drink hot cocoa.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta made hot cocoa in a mug with a panda design on it, and then brought the baked toast over the mug to Kaede.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;By this time, she had already finished the fried egg and sausage, and she began to tear the toast and eat it with the hot cocoa.

But today was a little different. There seemed to be more pedestrians on the road than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And there were many people carrying small bags with gifts. There were many people dressed up more than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was Christmas Eve in the city, and the pedestrians on the road were creating a festive atmosphere. He saw this scene on the three-dimensional sidewalk at the north entrance of the station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a small square in front of a home appliance store, which was a good place to stop. There were quite a few men and women waiting for someone here. Sakuta was one of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;One by one, they waited for their appointments and walked happily toward the ticket gate. Some held hands, some held arms, some were nervous and deliberately pulled back a bit......they all enjoyed the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The big clock standing in the square pointed to 12:29.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was still one minute to go before the appointed time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was staring at the minute hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s been a long time&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, someone said that to him from behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a girl who was a little younger than himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was Sara Himeji.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was wearing a white knit shirt with a chocolate colored jacket over it and a dark gray chevron skirt underneath. The weather was so cold and she still had bare legs, which was dazzling. On her feet, she was wearing black boots. The overall tone is dark, except for a bright red scarf full of Christmas atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The man who was playing with his cell phone next to Sakuta looked at Sara unobtrusively. In his mind, he was probably thinking, &quot;This girl is pretty.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please tell me what you think.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s expression looked a little mischievous. She was asking Sakuta to give a reply like &quot;You&#39;re so cute&quot; or &quot;You look so pretty in this outfit&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m cold even looking at it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at her legs and said what he really thought. It was really cold to look at, and Sakuta really winced when he saw her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have to talk so badly. Then why don&#39;t you come and help me pick out my clothes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; Sara made a show of puffing up her cheeks to show her anger. Her gaze was provocative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Then I&#39;ll do what I want.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s going to get colder in the evening. Let&#39;s go to the store and buy you something to protect you from the cold.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said as he walked towards the station building. There was a clothing store there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You, are you serious?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara followed, but she was only joking, so she looked a bit puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m really cold when you&#39;re dressed like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was his sincere statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant. You know that, but you&#39;re not asking the right questions.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He walked quickly into the building, ignoring Sara&#39;s complaints. After spending about thirty minutes shopping, Sakuta and Sara went to the Enoden Fujisawa station and boarded the train to Kamakura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They sat side by side in the corner seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The train started up. Sara looked at her legs with hatred. She played her legs straight. She wore black leggings on her legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Tuck your long legs in, they&#39;ll get in the way.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing his reminder, Sara silently tucked her legs away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve been trying to figure out what to wear today for a week now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara now sounded as if she was making a presentation at the academy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then you should consider the temperature today when making your choice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The tram stopped briefly at the proverbial station and then started moving again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think you&#39;re the kind of person who would like a short skirt and bare legs.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I do. But I can&#39;t let a student catch a cold just because I like it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I won&#39;t catch a cold.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please explain your reasoning.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta asked her in the form of a test question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because the skirt of the school uniform is shorter than this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara also started to prove her correctness by answering the question in the same format.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes went to a female high school student who was standing by the door. That girl happened to be wearing a short skirt with bare legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t you look cold dressed like that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course it&#39;s cold.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta had even seen Juri wearing a pair of sweatpants under her skirt. But Sara would never do that. I guess it&#39;s the age where you don&#39;t want to be warm for the sake of cuteness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The train stopped at Shichirigahama station. This is the closest station to Minohara High School. This high school is Sakuta&#39;s alma mater and also the high school Sara is currently attending. Several students in school uniforms got off the bus at this station. The one carrying a big bag was probably a member of the volleyball club. It seemed that they were still participating in club activities even on Christmas Eve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The doors closed and the train started moving again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The train passed the crossing and moved slowly, stopping at Inamurazaki station. After the Fujisawa-bound train passed, it started moving again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking out the window, you could see the sea from time to time between the gaps in the houses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At times like this, Sakuta would always look out the window looking for the sea. But before the next gap where the sea could be seen, the train stopped at Jirakuji station. The station was quiet, which suited the name of the station. There were few people getting on and off here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei. Do you still remember our promise?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara spoke up in the silence of the carriage. Her tone was different from before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You and I agreed that you wouldn&#39;t cure my adolescent syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I remember.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;But you&#39;re a liar, I&#39;m not confident.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said so with a smile while sticking her pinky finger in front of Sakuta. It was asking him to make a pinky promise with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta silently hooked her pinky finger with her own. The car door closed. The conductor said over the radio, &#39;The train is about to depart&#39;, and then the train drove off. The surroundings suddenly became very dark. It was because the train had entered the tunnel. The tunnel between Jokurakuji and Nagaya stations was the only tunnel on Enoden&#39;s route.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The light from outside was blocked and the sound of the train moving echoed through the tunnel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Pinky swear&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara recited the mantra in a voice that only she and Sakuta could hear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Liar&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile the tram moved through the tunnel, heading towards the light ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Has to swallow a thousand needles&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;We&#39;re almost at the exit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s pulling up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The light gradually shone into the carriage, while Sara finished her last phrase.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s pinky finger and Sara&#39;s pinky finger separated. After the tram went through the tunnel, the envious sunlight shone in. Light shone into his eyes and he couldn&#39;t help but close them. Then his whole field of vision became white. Sakuta felt a little unbelievable, and that&#39;s when his consciousness began to blur.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The moment he felt that something was wrong, he woke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was his right hand. Just now, he was pulling the hook with Sara with his right hand. Then he saw Nasuno&#39;s face. It was licking Sakuta&#39;s pinky finger. Behind Nasuno&#39;s back, there was the familiar white ceiling. Ever since I moved to Fujisawa, I&#39;ve woken up every day to this ceiling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So I was dreaming......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta propped himself up, feeling incredulous. The bed, the sheets, the desk, the curtains......all proved that this was indeed his room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The clock by the pillow did indeed show December 3rd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this really reality?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nasuno also looked up at Sakuta, he naturally did not give an answer, but just yawned a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa, finish cleaning up this table and then you can rest&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta was picking up the steel plate that originally contained the hamburger meat and the plate that contained the rice when he heard the shop manager say this to himself from behind him. The store manager was doing alcohol disinfection.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The lunchtime rush had passed, and there were many more empty seats in the family restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll take a break then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, yes, wait a minute.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was about to go back to the kitchen with the dishes when the manager stopped him again. The manager seemed to have remembered something else, and he couldn&#39;t just ignore it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is there anything else?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can you come to work on Christmas Day, the 24th or the 25th?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry, I have plans for both days.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, I knew it. It&#39;s Christmas after all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta apologized again and went back to the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He gave the dishes to the lady who worked at the dishwasher, and poured a cup of tea for the staff and took it to the lounge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When I put the cup on the table, he saw a flyer on the table that said &#39;Urgent recruitment! Christmas allowance available! There is a Christmas allowance! There was also a phrase &quot;Free cake&quot; on the back. I could see that the manager was really impatient.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Christmas ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta sat down on a pole chair and pondered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;How will he spend Christmas this year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Until last night, Sakuta could still imagine a sweet Christmas with Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the dream that he sat in this morning certainly broke a pot of cold water for him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Since it was just a dream, he naturally would not take it to heart. But this dream is really something he should take seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because this dream is likely to be a precognitive dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; The dream of Sara coming to cram school came true......this dream today, and that dream is exactly the same feeling. It was only when he woke up that he noticed it was in a dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If the dream that I sat in this morning would also become reality, there would be many problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;First of all, Sakuta was not with Mai on December 24. Obviously just last night we had a date to go on a trip......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason, the one who was with him that day was Sara Himeji, who had just become his student.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, Sara also said something that made him concerned.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;You and I agreed that you won&#39;t cure my puberty syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta doesn&#39;t know why she made such a pact with her. At least for now he hadn&#39;t made such a pact with her. But she contained a message in that paragraph.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was that she was suffering from adolescent syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She admitted it herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now we&#39;re in trouble.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta subconsciously muttered to himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you in trouble, senpai?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#39;t expect to get a response from her. At that moment, Tomoe came out of the ladies&#39; dressing room after changing into her waitress uniform.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I had a strange dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh? You had it too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe looked a little surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re asking that, it means you had that dream too, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe looked at the clock and it was 2:55. She walked into the lounge and sat down opposite to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not me. It&#39;s Nana.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nana means her friend, Nana Yoneyama.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said she had a very real dream this morning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe put her phone down on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What dream?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let me think about it......It doesn&#39;t seem to be a problem to tell you. It&#39;s just as well that I have something to ask you&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had just gone through a battle of ideas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nana has got a boyfriend. I told you this before, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I remember you saying that she was with her high school friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yeah. And then......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe stumbled over her words a bit. She turned her head away in embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And then?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She had a dream. She dreamed about the day before Christmas.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The day before Christmas&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the same day as Sakuta&#39;s dream. Is that really a coincidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She said that in her dream she kissed her boyfriend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe glared at him after she said that. It was as if he had done something wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How did the kiss happen?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What kind of question is that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Was the atmosphere just right, or was it forced by the opposite party&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If it was the latter, then things were a little different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She initiated it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yoneyama is good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She was just telling me about it today. She said she wouldn&#39;t know what to do if this dream really came true like those &#39;#dreaming&#39; tweets......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe looked a little unsettled. She picked up her phone that was on the table again and held it tightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you think she should do, Boss?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think a kiss is a kiss&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But she was worried if it was wrong for her to do that as a senior. ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe opened her phone and operated it. She was probably checking her chat with Nana.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I did make out with Mai last year, though in a restrained manner&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t compare Nana to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you feel guilty, turn it into motivation and study harder.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was being forced to study by Mai at that time. Even though she gave out candy along with the bat, the ratio of bat to candy was 100 to 1......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s true&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that Tomoe was thinking the same thing. But she didn&#39;t want to be irresponsible and tell her friends her subjective thoughts, so she thought of discussing it with Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe was already typing on her phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think Yoneyama also wants an affirmative answer before she discusses it with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s a redundant statement from you. Ah, she replied to me, she said &#39;Thank you for your advice, I&#39;ll try my best&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Does this effort mean study effort or relationship effort? Maybe it was both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t realize that so many people believe in &quot;#dreaming&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s been a lot of talk about it in school lately.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I see.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At least nothing unpleasant had happened to Sakuta so far. But he had a hunch that something bad would happen if he let the rumor continue to spread widely. The more the rumors spread, the more true it will be, and if everyone believes it, then it may become more than just a supernatural rumor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because if a bad future is foreseen, most people will want to change.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s probably a bit too much to think about at this stage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So what dream did you have?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m a little embarrassed to tell you after hearing Yoneyama&#39;s dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If I told Tomoe that I had a date with Sara in my dream, God knows what Tomoe would say. Anyway, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll curse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re still embarrassed?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe said something hurtful lightly and looked at her phone at the same time. She swiped the screen of her phone, probably because she had received a new message. Then she suddenly looked up at Sakuta alertly and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Senpai, what did you do to Himeji?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe uttered a name that came as a surprise. Sakuta happened to be concerned about that name now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t do anything. But she started coming to my classes this month&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Sakuta stated the facts. Right now he and Sara were just a normal teacher-student relationship. That&#39;s true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, if that dream comes true, something might change in the future ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then she asked me for your phone number, maybe that&#39;s why&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe handed over her phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Speaking of which, I don&#39;t think I told her that I don&#39;t have a cell phone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll tell her I&#39;m working with you at the family restaurant, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After hearing Sakuta&#39;s reply, Tomoe put the phone back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What time are you working?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nine o&#39;clock.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She asked me to ask you if you have time to finish your work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was about to answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And she said she would wait for you in the study room while she studied.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe then read out the next message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was just as well that Sakuta had something to ask her. About the dream and her adolescent syndrome. It was good to see her today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She even said, &quot;Sakuta-sensei, I&#39;ll wait for you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She also said to you, &#39;Sakuta-sensei, I&#39;ll wait for you&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe&#39;s tone suddenly became polite. The expression on her face didn&#39;t look too happy, and her eyes said &#12302;I have a problem with you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nothing...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe replied with two words full of meaning and then stood up. It was almost time to go to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji is very popular. Be careful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Without waiting for Sakuta to ask what he should be careful of, Tomoe was already walking to the lobby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was 9:05 when he finished his shift and came out of the family restaurant. Knowing that Sara was waiting for her, he chose to clock out at nine o&#39;clock sharp today. After punching in, he quickly changed his clothes and headed out. He didn&#39;t meet a single colleague on the way who said, &quot;I&#39;ll go first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As I walked towards the station, the roads were decorated in Christmas style. I didn&#39;t take a few steps before I heard footsteps behind me. The person behind me pounced on me when I had a question mark in my head. At the same time she also covered Sakuta eyes with her woolen gloved hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Guess who I am&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta knew someone who liked to play pranks like this. She was the first person he thought of, but she was nowhere near Okinawa. And if it was really her, Sakuta would have recognized her by the sound of her voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;He thought about it a little. But the need to think about the matter itself gave him the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s Himeji who&#39;s lazy and not studying for her exams.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Unfortunately, you guessed wrong.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice let go of her hand and said a little unhappily. At the same time, she moved her body away from Sakuta and came around from behind him to the front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The correct answer is, &quot;I&#39;m tired of studying and came out to take a nap&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara had a smile on her face. She seemed to be very happy with this one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you can do these kinds of childish pranks too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was one of the more dependable ones among her peers. Sakuta thought she was calm and mature. So what she did just now was a bit surprising to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m just a kid. A full three years younger than you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She made a three with her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think people who can say they are children are quite mature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At least, Sara&#39;s actions and words were intended to take advantage of her status as a child.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you think I&#39;m mature?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think you&#39;re a typical adolescent.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said that word deliberately to probe her. If she was suffering from the same adolescent syndrome as he had learned about through his dream, then she might have some reaction to this word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; But Sara didn&#39;t change her tone at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re right. It is indeed puberty.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She simply admitted frankly. There was no hint of wariness. No surprise, no confusion, no anxiety. Always a soft, smiling face. Nothing could be seen this way. It seems the only way to try is from another direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right. I left my bag in the study room.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then let&#39;s go to the cram school first. It&#39;s cold in here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was already 9:30 p.m., but the after-school program was still lit up. That&#39;s not possible at school. But it&#39;s only natural to be in a cram school. But today is Saturday after all, so it was a little less crowded than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is there anyone in the classroom?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re in class now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll go get my bag, wait for me in class.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sara went to get her bag, and Sakuta went into the classroom as she had said. The other day, she had attended a class in this small partitioned classroom. The classroom was a facade, but in fact it was just a small cubicle with a few desks and chairs and a whiteboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He came to the whiteboard, and Sara entered the classroom with her bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara naturally drew out a chair and sat down at the table. The position relationship between the two was exactly the same as during the class. The only difference was that now she didn&#39;t have a study kit on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There was no one else, and it feels a little exciting.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara leaned out close to Sakuta, as if she were whispering. Naturally, her voice was also lowered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Usually there was always the sound of the teacher&#39;s lecture or the students&#39; questions in front and behind. Now there were no such voices, and he found it quite refreshing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re looking for me because you don&#39;t know a question on the final exam?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta teaches math, which was taken on the first day ...... that is, yesterday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The exam was perfectly fine. It&#39;s really a test on everything you went over .&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then it looks like there is hope for Yamada-san too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I hope so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara laughed a little snidely. He was in the same class as Kento, so she probably knew his situation. I&#39;m afraid Kento didn&#39;t say something like &quot;I&#39;m finished ......&quot; after the exam. It&#39;s really possible. I can already imagine he looked like that. Sakuta couldn&#39;t help but feel sad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The test was fine, so you&#39;re looking for me for......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He looked at Sara with a question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei ...... do you know &#39;#dreaming&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve been hearing a lot about it lately&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I was talking about it with Tomoe at my part-time job today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This morning ...... I had a strange dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right ...... strange dream&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t expect this to be the case. But when you think about it, it seems quite likely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I dreamed about the day before Christmas ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was with you on that day ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think, probably on a date.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Up to this point, the content of the dream was the same as the dream Sakuta had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And then I&#39;ll pinky promise with you on the Eno train?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey ......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The part at Jurakuji station.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked surprised to hear Sakuta&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Did you also have the same dream?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She confirmed his doubt with these words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. It looks like I dreamed of the same day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No. Can this really happen?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s voice sounded excited. It seemed her curiosity overrode her surprise and concern.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I guess it&#39;s true. After all, it actually happened.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If that dream was really a foretelling of the future......then the content of the dream that the two people involved had must be the same. If one of them was somewhere else doing something else at that time of day, then it wouldn&#39;t be right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If the dream is really about Sakuta and Sara&#39;s future, then there are some things that must be asked first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have something to ask you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;about puberty syndrome?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This time Sara spoke up before me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right. In the dream, you said that I made an appointment with you not to cure your adolescent syndrome. Are you really suffering from it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. I really have adolescent syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara admitted dryly. She smiled easily. There was no sense of confusion or low self-esteem. Like a person who is fine. It was like asking someone &#39;Are you practicing piano?&#39; She answered &quot;Yes.&quot; so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are the symptoms?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a secret.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her tone remained the same, but this time she refused to answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;When did it start?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The first morning after Golden Week.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She did answer that question. And quite precisely. It was December. Golden Week was more than six months ago. The fact that she remembers it so well means that something must have made a deep impression on her. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did you have a bad time?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I lost my love.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara also answered this question. She still looked as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t the kind of breakup that happens when you get dumped in the middle of a relationship. And it&#39;s not like being rejected.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Without waiting for Sakuta to say anything, Sara added this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a drama where the person you like already has a lover, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t say &quot;drama&quot;, okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta got it right, but the wording was a bit off. Sara acted a little shy and upset about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But you don&#39;t look like you&#39;re in any kind of trouble right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve come out of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her expression didn&#39;t look like she was lying. Nor did she look like she was trying to be tough. She still had the same confident attitude about her thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thanks to adolescent syndrome, I&#39;ve gotten over it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why he felt that this was her sincere statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But that&#39;s why Sakuta has doubts about one thing. If she said so clearly that she was &quot;over it,&quot; then why was she still suffering from adolescent syndrome? That was the only thing he couldn&#39;t figure out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now I am happy every day. So, just like I said in my dream......please don&#39;t cure my adolescent syndrome&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do I look like a doctor who can cure this weird disease to you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not at all&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara laughed out loud.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why do you think I said that in the dream?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, please don&#39;t tell anyone about this. It&#39;s our secret.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara suddenly remembered this and began to ask him to keep it a secret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please don&#39;t tell anyone. Of course it&#39;s the fact that I have puberty syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I won&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara put away her smile and looked up at him with a serious face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really. No one would believe me if I told them. They&#39;ll just think I&#39;m out of my mind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing Sakuta&#39;s reasonable explanation, Sara smiled and said &#39;come to think of it&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And I don&#39;t even know what your symptoms are, so how can I tell anyone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He asked her again in a roundabout way about her symptoms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You want to know?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She sensed exactly what he was trying to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, as long as it&#39;s harmless to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Here was the desire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, you should care more about your students.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But you wouldn&#39;t tell me if I cared.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll leave you an assignment. Go back and think about what my adolescent syndrome really is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I hate doing homework.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Remember to turn in your answers at the end of the semester.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What good will it do to do the homework?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s see. ...... If you get it right, I&#39;ll promise you one thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She thought for a moment, then threw a playful smile at Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No horny requests.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara laughed again. That&#39;s when the cell phone in her bag rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, it&#39;s so late.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s almost ten o&#39;clock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;My mom is picking me up from the station, I&#39;ll go first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara hurriedly stood up and picked up her bag while answering the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey, Mom. I&#39;m still in cram school, I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara hung up the phone after finishing her speech. As she walked out of the classroom, she looked back at Sakuta and said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t forget to do your homework&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She instructed Sakuta with a relaxed smile. He made a very reluctant face. She was satisfied to see his expression and jogged all the way out of the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t run in the hallway&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta made a show of reminding her, and she was gone before the words were finished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was left alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This feels weird.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to mention the progress. There are more and more problems. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... Anyway, let&#39;s go home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing can be solved by staying here. That was the only thing that was clear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta walked unhurriedly through the corridor that Sara had just run through and came to the rest area in front of the office. Inside the counter was the office, and there were lecturers working inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not wanting to disturb them either, Sakuta said &#39;I&#39;ll go first&#39; in a volume they couldn&#39;t necessarily hear, and then walked out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He pressed the elevator button. The elevator was already going up, so it came to him in less than ten seconds. The elevator bell rang and the door opened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A surprised voice came from the elevator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The fact that there was someone in the elevator and that they were surprised meant that they knew Sakuta. So he immediately asked her a question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Rio, what are you doing here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The one who came up in the elevator was Rio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I forgot something here yesterday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rio stepped out of the elevator and said the reason as if she was looking for an excuse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t often see you forgetting things.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And it was a bit unusual to come here at this time to pick it up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And why are you here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me being here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio&#39;s tone sounded a bit reproachful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have something to do. Now that I&#39;ve met you, I have something to discuss with you. Are you free next?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s getting late. I&#39;m lucky to run into Rio at a time like this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then wait for me. I also have something to discuss with you at ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I think it&#39;s unusual that Rio would ask someone to discuss something. This is also very unusual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio soon came out of the dressing room. She had a gray jacket in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this the one you forgot?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t ask questions, let&#39;s go.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio ignored Sakuta&#39;s question and went into the elevator. It was a bit ridiculous to forget a jacket at this time of year. It seems that something really unusual happened yesterday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why Rio said she wanted to talk to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Rio walked out of the cram school and towards the south side of the station. After walking along the Enoden Railway for a while, they came to a burger store. This store serves alcoholic beverages. There were already two other tables in the store drinking and having a good conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was so hungry that he ordered the signature burger of the restaurant. After a short wait, a steel plate with a thick burger was brought out. Rio ordered a latte, and he gobbled up the burger in front of her. The look on Rio&#39;s face was as if she was saying, &quot;I&#39;m impressed that you can eat something with so many calories at this moment.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After eating the burger, Sakuta told Rio about the day&#39;s events while eating his fries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He had a dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dream, he was with Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dream, she said she was suffering from puberty syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had just talked to her and confirmed that it was true.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He told Rio everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you broke your promise and told me someone&#39;s secret?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio said with a sigh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m a liar.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know that very well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So what do you think?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, this dream of yours explains why Sakurajima-san is in danger, doesn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Does it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was completely confused as to what Rio meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Dangerous means you&#39;re having an affair and then Sakurajima stabbed you in the back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... Indeed, it can also be said that &#39;Mai is in danger&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But that wouldn&#39;t be connected to &quot;going to find Kirishima Touko&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s put aside the joke.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why do I feel that this is not necessarily a joke?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio&#39;s tone was serious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you really think I&#39;m going to skip the hot spring trip with Mai and go on a date with Himeji?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If it&#39;s just a date, then I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s for sure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But if it&#39;s to cure her adolescent syndrome, then I don&#39;t know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If Himeji&#39;s puberty syndrome is a threat to Mai-san, then I would do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If that&#39;s the case, then there&#39;s no choice but to cancel the trip. Of course, Sakuta would prefer to postpone it rather than cancel it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think you would do it even if it had nothing to do with Sakurajima-senpai.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If it&#39;s not harmful to us, I really don&#39;t want to care. She said herself that she wants me not to cure her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If Sara herself wanted to maintain the status quo, then why should Sakuta make a fool of himself?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then in order to determine whether she is harmful or harmless, you&#39;ll just have to finish her homework first. After all, it may have something to do with those two messages.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s true.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If you know this, you can take the next step. It&#39;s because you don&#39;t know this that you have to do your homework.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Homework ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta muttered to himself reluctantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The most troublesome thing is that there are no clues at all. According to Sara, the reason she suffered from adolescent syndrome was because she lost her lover. And the timing was after Golden Week. That was all the information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If we don&#39;t get any more valid information, there is no way to solve the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you don&#39;t want to do the questions yourself, just get someone to copy the answers.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio made a not-so-decent suggestion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was willing to hear more. The rules were already ambiguous, so there was no need to get hung up on the means.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There is another person besides Sara Himeji who might know the answer, isn&#39;t there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing Rio say that, Sakuta thought of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Yes, oh, and Kirishima Touko&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If Sara&#39;s puberty syndrome was a gift from Touko, then it is indeed possible that Touko knows about her symptoms. Because Uzuki and also Ikumi&#39;s symptoms are known by Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyhow, I have to meet with her soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, there was a lot of things to ask Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The most important thing was perhaps to cure her of her adolescent syndrome. The quickest and most practical way to find clues for that was to meet with her in person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be good if I could ask Sara about her condition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think you&#39;re right. Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No thanks.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio picked up a French fry and ate it, seemingly as a token of appreciation from Sakuta. He waited for her to finish that fry and changed the subject.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So what is it that you want to discuss with me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;My word......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio lowered her head as she eyed the bubbles in her cafe latte.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#39;t say anything after waiting for half a day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed like a difficult question to ask.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why are you stammering? Did you get a confession?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had meant it as a joke to make her talk. But then she was shocked. He really didn&#39;t think this was the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio nodded gently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By whom?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The one from the cram school......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, Toranosuke Kasai, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How did you know about......?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio raised her eyes to glare at him. But her face was so red, she was not intimidating at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I know, he obviously likes you, doesn&#39;t he?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Then why didn&#39;t you tell me earlier?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes held some resentment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because it&#39;s more fun......of course it&#39;s a joke. If I told you, wouldn&#39;t I be sorry to Ka sai-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio&#39;s silence spoke of her discontent. But in this case, Sakuta shouldn&#39;t have done anything wrong. People have their own thoughts, so it&#39;s not right for outsiders to say anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, when?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yesterday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio muttered, holding her cup in her hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Where?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In the cram school classroom.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What was the context?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I saw that he wasn&#39;t concentrating very well lately, so I thought something was bothering him......so I asked him, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you lately?&quot; and then it happened......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then it&#39;s your fault for asking the wrong question.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have asked if you had told me in advance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did you give him an answer?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Before I could answer him, he said, &#39;No need to answer now&#39; and left.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was probably too embarrassed. Sakuta had seen him standing next to Rio in cram school, and he looked so confused.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you think I should do?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can do whatever you want to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I just haven&#39;t thought about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then take this opportunity to think about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t want to hear a standard answer like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is a good opportunity for you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta took a sip of the coffee he had ordered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What opportunity?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The chance that the sky is the limit. Stop thinking about Kunimi.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not thinking about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you sure you haven&#39;t seen a man and compared him to Kunimi?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......I&#39;m not.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although Rio said no, her attitude was very unconvincing. Of course, it wasn&#39;t like she was consciously trying to make a comparison. But after hearing Sakuta say that, she probably noticed that she was subconsciously making comparisons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Compare less. There aren&#39;t many men who are better than Kunimi. The only thing wrong with Kunimi is that he has a bad eye for women.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;His girlfriend is very nice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;When she heard that his mother worked in a hospital, she decided to become a nurse herself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How do you know this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Before I graduated, I asked Kunimi, &quot;What do you like about her?&quot; and then he told me this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......You ask really scary questions.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s not good for the heart to hear that. It&#39;s been a long time since then, but it&#39;s still hard to hear her say this now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, wait a minute. According to you, do you also know that Kamisato is in our school nursing program?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I knew&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Yuuma didn&#39;t tell Sakuta, and neither did Rio. It was more than six months after she entered the school that he met Saki Kamisato, and it was at the sorority house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that time, Saki was almost scared to death. Now Sakuta wanted to ask why Rio hadn&#39;t told him earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re still friends, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There are things you can&#39;t say because you&#39;re friends.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But at least not about this. Absolutely not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio took another French fry and ate it. After eating, she wiped her fingers and whispered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yeah?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m a little calmer after talking to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you want to talk to me about something so interesting, I&#39;m always welcome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I won&#39;t talk to you anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio finished the rest of her coffee. The clock in the store was already past 11:30. The store was about to close.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;4</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta had been working part-time all weekend. By Monday it was back to normal life with classes at the university.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Every morning when he goes to school, he looks for Touko on the ginkgo boulevard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When changing classrooms, when going to the cafeteria, when going home......Sakuta is always on the lookout for a miniskirt Santa in the crowd. But after the day she was invited to eat Mont Blanc, he never saw her again in college.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The phone calls still came every day. Every day, under the blank stare of Kaede, he left recorded messages for her. But she never answered, and she never returned the calls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A week passed, and by Friday, things were still not going anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;December 9.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was packing up the empty bento boxes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I feel like there are more of them lately.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, Takumi looked out of the classroom window and said thoughtfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He stood up and walked over to Takumi.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Men and women in a relationship&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Overlooking the road next to the main school building from the third floor, a couple could be seen happily walking down the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Both of them were laughing, and it looked like they were having some funny jokes just now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, it&#39;s the season of lovers. A series of holidays in a row&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi&#39;s tone was full of envy and jealousy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s the list?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;First, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is it possible that both days are included in Christmas?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And then New Year&#39;s Eve and New Year&#39;s Day, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can this really be considered a couple&#39;s holiday?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What? You mean you&#39;re not going to spend it with Sakurajima-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes I will.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Only if Mai is free. ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You see. So it is a couple&#39;s holiday. I think you&#39;re too happy to be a couple.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s a harsh statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The first thing that happens after the first month is the festival, then Valentine&#39;s Day, and then White Valentine&#39;s Day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This includes a holiday that is obviously not right, but Sakuta is too deliberate to point it out. First of all, these holidays are a long time away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s not talk about next year&#39;s holidays, let&#39;s just have Christmas first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Those were the two days Sakuta was most concerned about this year. Whether he would spend them with Mai as arranged, or with Sara as in his dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In order to find a girlfriend before then, I had someone arrange a date for me. You can come and support me when it&#39;s decided&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No. I don&#39;t have a good impression of sorority&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta met someone unexpected for the first time in his life and made it very awkward. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll never forget this bad memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey, look, that couple is also a couple, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi pointed out the window. Where there was a man and woman. They were laughing and joking, and the girl was pushing the boy&#39;s back and running. Both of them were laughing loudly, wondering where they were having so much fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Love is blind&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi said so indifferently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta looked out the window and didn&#39;t respond. Because his attention had already shifted to something else. A red figure was walking down the boulevard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the familiar mini-skirt Santa Claus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was also no doubt that that back was Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta immediately rushed out without even grabbing his bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you doing? Where are you going? It&#39;s time for class.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Tell the professor I&#39;m going to the bathroom.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then Sakuta rushed out of the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t. It&#39;s embarrassing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was already down the stairs when she heard Takumi&#39;s response.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The class bell rang just as he ran outside the building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The students were rushing to the main building, so Sakuta went against the flow and came to the boulevard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was walking towards the main entrance when she suddenly stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The person she was looking for was about ten meters ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko put her phone on the bench, then walked along the boulevard for about ten steps......Then she returned to the bench and picked up her phone to look at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What is she doing here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Touko didn&#39;t seem very satisfied. She stood the phone on the bench again and then took a few more steps like she did earlier. Her steps were a bit contrived, like a model walking down the runway......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta walked over to her and talked to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Um...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t come over. You&#39;ll be in the picture.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko turned her head with an impatient look on her face, and she came over with a big stride, looking a little angry, but instead of stopping, she walked straight over to the bench and picked up her phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m taking videos for the Christmas song.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Didn&#39;t you already release the Christmas song? It was on the night I invited you to eat Mont Blanc.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s another one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#39;t even look at Sakuta as she responded, but once again put the phone up on the bench. But as soon as she let go, the phone fell down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you need help?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing too well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then follow me while you film me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko handed over the phone, which was already in shooting mode.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Press the red dot and you can start shooting.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko said as she walked along. Sakuta followed her instructions and followed her while filming her back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, the boulevard was mostly empty now that classes were in session. Sakuta didn&#39;t have to get any blank stares. The few people who did pass by occasionally didn&#39;t feel too strange about his actions. In this day and age, it&#39;s not too uncommon for people to walk while shooting video.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I talk?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta asked to Touko after making sure no one was around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter, the sound will be cut out, but don&#39;t give me any trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please tell me about Sara Himeji&#39;s symptoms of puberty syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said that, so Sakuta went straight to the point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Who is that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko walked ahead, and her response to him seemed cold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a student I teach in a cram school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then how can I possibly know what&#39;s going on with her?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She said herself that she was suffering from adolescent syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And then what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I was thinking, &quot;If this is a gift from you, then you might know what&#39;s going on with her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko said while stopping to look back, she took a big step and took the phone out of Sakuta&#39;s hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But puberty syndrome indeed should be my gift to her&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She started browsing through the video Sakuta had just taken.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; The video keeps showing the back of the miniskirt Santa. Sakuta and Touko&#39;s conversation was also recorded in detail. In the video, she also says that she doesn&#39;t know Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But don&#39;t you know the symptoms of Hirokawa and Akagi?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because they are both students of this university.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The look in Touko&#39;s eyes seemed to be asking Sakuta to not ask something about this. It didn&#39;t look like she was trying to cover up. Nor did it look like she was teasing him. She was just stating the truth. And a little impatient at the same time......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Looks like the cheating failed.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This left Sakuta with no means of knowing Sara&#39;s symptoms. He had to wait for the strange phenomenon to happen. There was no way to know without getting caught up in it. Although Sakuta didn&#39;t want to, there was no other way out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you. Nice shot.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;While he had nothing to show for it, Touko was quite satisfied after watching the video.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you need a cameraman, you can call me anytime.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So? Then you should come here on the 24th, I want to broadcast live that day. I&#39;ll see you at 4:00 p.m.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, I&#39;m a little......on the 24th.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll see you there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta called out to her and she ignored him, just walked quickly towards the main entrance. She soon walked out of the university, never to be seen at his back again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t mess up my 24th any more will you......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were already enough problems with a strange dream. Now Touko comes back with a one-sided no-see. How will Sakuta explain this to Mai?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Anyway, let&#39;s go back to class&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The professor will be worried if I take too long to go to the bathroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;5</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The next day, December 10, Saturday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the morning, I cleaned and did laundry, and then I gave Nasuno a bath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai had an interview with a magazine in the afternoon, so Sakuta dropped her off and left the house at 4:00. He had to go to a cram school at six.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason why I left earlier was because I was in a hurry. The reason for the urgency was clear to Sakuta himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was because of Sara&#39;s homework.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The assignment was due today. But he still had a blank paper in his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if he went out, it didn&#39;t mean that he could do his homework. But staying at home, Nasuno couldn&#39;t tell him the answer. So Sakuta hoped that going out would at least ease his restlessness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If he got to cram school early, he could prepare for class, or at least have something to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And maybe he could think of something on the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had a little hope for that. But when he got to Fujisawa Station, he still hadn&#39;t come up with anything. There were still too few clues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With heavy steps, Sakuta stepped out onto the three-dimensional sidewalk. At that moment, someone spoke to him from behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That, Azusagawa-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a male voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t tell from the voice who the other person was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta looked back with a question, and saw a high wall behind him. He was Toranosuke Kasai. The boy was almost 5&#39;9&quot; tall, and he was looking down at Sakuta, wearing the Minegahara High School school uniform. He was carrying a large bag with his club sportswear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry to call you so suddenly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I have a moment of your time?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m free ...... but are you sure you&#39;re looking for me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was normal for him to feel puzzled, since Sakuta and Toranosuke hadn&#39;t crossed paths so far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not looking for Futaba?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m looking for you, Azusagawa-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Sakuta&#39;s words left his mouth, Toranosuke replied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then let&#39;s talk about it at the cram school first?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, no, it&#39;s better ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke&#39;s gaze wandered a bit. It looked like he couldn&#39;t let too many people know what he was going to say next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then let&#39;s find a place to sit.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was early in the day and there was still some time before class.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Toranosuke went to the restaurant where he was working. Tomoe, who was working, looked at Sakuta with a suspicious look on her face, and took them to the innermost seat and sat down. This was a good place for whispering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They each ordered a drink buffet and poured a cup of coffee and a coke respectively and returned to their seats.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Tell me, what is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, Sakuta had basically decided that he wanted to talk about Rio. Because other than that, he couldn&#39;t think of anything he could talk to himself about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But what Toranosuke said was another unexpected name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You better be more careful with Sara......no, Himeji&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What he said made Sakuta&#39;s mind spin a little. Why did he first address Sara directly and then change his words to &#39;Himeji&#39;. Why did he need to pay more attention to Sara. A long line of questions lined up in his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you mean, what do I need to be careful about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was confused, so he had to solve the problem one by one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sara, no, Himeji&#39;s teacher has been changed three times.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can just call her by her name.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke frankly accepted Sakuta&rsquo;s suggestion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know the previous teacher who taught Himeji, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike Sakuta, he was not a part-time teacher, but a full-time tutor. He was in his early twenties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then do you know why he was replaced?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sort of.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To put it bluntly, the teacher almost had an affair with a student. Then something goes wrong......It&#39;s pretty common.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The one before that teacher, the one who taught Sara in the beginning, was replaced for the same reason.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the first time Sakuta knows about this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, the first one had a thing for Himeji, too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke nodded silently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I heard that several boys at school had confessed their love to Sara......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s normal, she seems to be very popular.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She has excellent grades and is friendly and polite. She always has a smile on her face and makes the atmosphere very lively. She is also not afraid of people, and will take the initiative to communicate with people she doesn&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She is such a person, so it is only natural that she is popular with the opposite sex. If I were to give an example from the people around Sakuta, Kento is a good example of someone who is attracted to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re afraid that there are too many guys who like her, why don&#39;t you just keep an eye out for her? Aren&#39;t you guys close enough to call each other by your first names?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke simply dismissed Sakuta&#39;s idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;My house is next door to hers......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can&#39;t because you live close to her?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That can&#39;t be the reason. There was more to Toranosuke&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Both parents are very close......We used to play together when we were kids.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You were childhood friends, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I guess so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He acted as if he was not involved. To the people involved, that kind of relationship is so natural that they probably didn&#39;t even consider that it was called &quot;childhood friend&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And then, I always thought I liked her until I was in high school.....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He suddenly said what he really meant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We were always together. People around us liked to joke that we were playing friends......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That does happen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The people around us were up in arms, mostly out of envy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I felt like we were going to be together for real.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But that&#39;s not the case.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because Toranosuke had already confessed to Rio. And Sakuta knew about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. The kind of feelings I used to think were love, but maybe they weren&#39;t. I noticed that at some point.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s because you&#39;re in love with Futaba?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He subconsciously replied in the affirmative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey?!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It took him a while to respond. His face also turned red. His mouth opened and closed, trying desperately to say something. But in the end, no words came out, and his eyes remained unfocused in the air. He tried to ease the embarrassment, he took a sip of Coke through a straw. But he seemed to have pushed a little too hard, irritated his throat, and choked and coughed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why do you know?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke asked the question thirty seconds after Sakuta had said that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;When you approached Rio at the cram school and asked her a question, it was written all over your body that you liked her&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, Toranosuke couldn&#39;t speak. It felt like if there was a bottom hole here, he would have gone down it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Rio is a tough nut to crack, so go for it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay, okay. No, that&#39;s not right! Let&#39;s not talk about it!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke shrunk his large body into a tiny ball and tried desperately to get the conversation back on track.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, what&#39;s her attitude towards you, Himeji?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think she used to like me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Before&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know about now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s normal. Toranosuke is not Sara. Sara&#39;s feelings are her own. People&#39;s feelings are so complicated that sometimes they can&#39;t even understand them. Toranosuke himself was the same way before he met Rio......The slightest mistake, people will misunderstand, will make assumptions, will be wrong. And people often do not know it themselves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In your opinion, what kind of person is Himeji?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you mean by what kind of person?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;For example, she&#39;s cheerful, polite, and easy to get along with. Was she like that before?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. When she was in kindergarten, she was like that. She always had a smile on her face and was the center of the crowd.....Or rather, people would naturally flock to her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Even in elementary school?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Even in middle school?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And before high school, everyone around you thought you and her were boyfriend and girlfriend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Her life was too full. She probably hadn&#39;t felt much frustration before she was essentially dumped by Toranosuke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So this incident hit her so hard that it caused her to suffer from adolescent syndrome. When you think about it that way, it makes sense. But it&#39;s a little too easy to think about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;All in all, it&#39;s after you dumped her......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, after you basically dumped her, she started becoming particularly popular with boys......and then you were worried about her?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. So I was hoping you could keep an eye on her for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But why did you come to me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Toranosuke didn&#39;t cross paths. There must be some reason for him to come to him out of the blue to talk about this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I called Kunimi-senpai yesterday and talked about it. Then he asked me to come to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Kunimi is not happy without saying too much, is he?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think you have a great girlfriend, so I think you&#39;re different from the teachers who taught Sara before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta felt that he could understand what Toranosuke was saying, but felt that his thoughts were a bit biased. But his thought process was clear. He thought that since Sakuta was dating &#12302;Sakurajima Mai&#12303;, &nbsp;he shouldn&#39;t be able to fall in love with Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d like to ask for your help, Azusagawa-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke lowered his head again and made a request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was concerned about a particularly popular student. It wasn&#39;t Sakuta&#39;s place to do that. Nor was it the business of a teacher in a cram school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m just a math teacher,&quot; he said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Toranosuke was sincere, and he called Sakuta a &#39;teacher&#39; anyhow. ...... Then Sakuta, as an elder, couldn&#39;t ignore his request.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Moreover, now Sara is Sakuta&#39;s student. It&#39;s still a delicate connection of having the same dream. She also left Sakuta a puzzle as homework, asking him to guess her symptoms. To say whether Sakuta is paying attention or not, in fact he was already very concerned about her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What Toranosuke just said might also be related to Sara&#39;s adolescent syndrome. It would be worthwhile to think about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll try to keep an eye on it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing his reply, Toranosuke finally lifted his head up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke sighed in relief, and Sakuta felt a bit of the childishness that should be present in his expression at that age. At the same time, he noticed that the fact that he would give such a comment to someone meant that he was not the same high middle schooler.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Toranosuke settled their bill and walked out of the family restaurant. The time was past 5:30 pm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The sun had gone down completely after the two of them had been out for half a day. The streetlights were already on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke also had to attend class afterwards, so Sakuta walked with him to the business building in front of the station where the cram school was located.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Toranosuke chatted for a while and lost time thinking about their homework. But it was a crooked way to learn more about Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;From what they both said, it seems that the person Sara dumped before Sara confessed was Tonomosuke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After that, Sara became loved by everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He wondered if this phenomenon was triggered by puberty syndrome. Sakuta had not encountered a similar situation before. Just considering the perspective of time, there should be some relationship between the two. Of course this could be just subjective speculation on his part, after all, there are so few clues now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If you think about it calmly, the possibility that there is no relationship between the two is not unlikely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Maybe because Sara and Toranosuke had cleared their relationship, the boys who had been interested in Sara before had started to get excited all together. Maybe that&#39;s all there is to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The answer to the assignment was still far away. But now it&#39;s not a blank slate. Thanks to Toranosuke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is Rio giving you a lesson today?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta saw that Toranosuke&#39;s expression was a little nervous, so he struck up a conversation with him. He had been moving stiffly since he stepped out of the restaurant. His whole body was tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. But I&#39;ve given up chasing after Rio-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because last week ...... I had a dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Dream ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I dreamed that I was rejected by her on Christmas Eve.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t feel like a coincidence anymore. Sakuta had already heard three dreams about Christmas Eve from people. His own dream with Sara, Nana&#39;s dream through Tomoe, and now Toranosuke&#39;s Christmas Eve dreams.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s very popular now, you know, &#39;#dreaming&#39;, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What did Futaba say in the dream?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh? She said ...... &#39;I can&#39;t go out with students&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you gave up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;To be honest, I don&#39;t know myself. Even after having that dream ...... I was still thinking about Rio-sensei ...... I actually thought it might not work at first, but I just, how can I say it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke thought it was a little less clear. Finally apologized to him and closed his mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was anxious, dedicated, awkward and reckless. But equally sincere, Sakuta felt very youthful even looking at him. So he couldn&#39;t help but want to say something to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If I had been rejected, I would have said, &quot;Please go out with me if I get into the first university I want to go to&quot;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke is only a sophomore in high school. He still has a year to go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When Toranosuke heard Sakuta&#39;s sudden suggestion, his whole body froze. By the look on his face, he didn&#39;t seem to understand what Sakuta had said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t give up if you really like her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay, fine. I&#39;ll do my best ......!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He seemed to finally understand what Sakuta was saying and responded. His tone was a bit strange with a mixture of impatience and joy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course, you should study hard too. Lest Rio come find me when the time comes&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay. Of course I will! Then, that, Azusagawa-sensei, I&#39;m really......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke was about to thank him, when his shoulders suddenly twitched. He looked behind Sakuta, in the direction of the station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Excuse me, I&#39;ll go first&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He said this quickly and ran like hell into the business building where the cram school was located.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Someone called out to Sakuta from behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Here you are, Rio&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio came from the direction of the station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta could understand why Toranosuke was running away. But he had to attend Rio&#39;s class next, I don&#39;t know how he was going to do it ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Was Kasai here just now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke was tall and, frankly, conspicuous. It shouldn&#39;t be too far to look away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;He said they were childhood friends.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Who and who?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio looked puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Kakashi and Himeji. I just heard him say that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;...... Azusagawa, you didn&#39;t say anything to him that you shouldn&#39;t, did you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Somehow, her eyes were already accusing Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I only said what I should have said.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What you think you should say is probably what I think you shouldn&#39;t say.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio seemed to want to complain a little more. But before she could speak again, a voice interrupted her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice was cheerful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The owner of the voice was Sara, who was running this way from the direction of the station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t know why she was so happy until she ran up to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Look, look, look.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She reached into her school bag and pulled out a piece of paper that was right up. She spread the piece of paper out and displayed it in front of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the answer sheet for the math test, with circles for correct answers. There was not a single cross. In other words, she had gotten a perfect score.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This class is not going to be easy. I was going to review your mistakes today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She came over with a perfect answer sheet, and he had nothing better to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can&#39;t you give me a compliment first?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You did really well on the test.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll leave now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rio said a quick goodbye to Sakuta and then headed for the building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m going up too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Both Sakuta and Sara were going to the same place with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So the three of them got on the elevator together. Rio was in front of the button. Sakuta stood in the corner behind her and Sara was next to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;No one said anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s cold today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Once again, there was silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When you think about it, it&#39;s kinda awkward for the two of them to meet. Sara could be considered dumped by Toranosuke, and Toranosuke likes Rio......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The elevator carried the three to the cram school, during which a sense of tension inexplicably filled the entire elevator.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were three answer sheets on the table. Starting from the left, they were thirty points, one hundred points, and forty-five points. They were Kento&#39;s, Sara&#39;s, and Juri&#39;s, respectively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada, you like 30 perecent so much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the midterm exam, he also brought over an answer sheet with a score of thirty&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, you&#39;re giving away my privacy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento tried to hide the exam results from Sara without saying anything. But it was too late. A quick glance showed that there were crosses everywhere and not many circles. Sara should have seen it too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll focus on the questions Yamada and Yoshikazu got wrong, and Himeji, you can listen to them as a review.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara got a perfect score on the test, but it turned out that she listened to the lesson most carefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After Sakuta finished his explanation, he gave them exercises with similar problems. There were three exercises in total.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara finished them in less than ten minutes. Sara raised her hand when she was done and said, &quot;I&#39;ve done it&quot;. The calculations in her notebook were very neatly written.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta gave her a new practice problem and went to check the progress of Kento and Juri. Kento was deep in thought on the first problem. Juri didn&#39;t move her pen at all until the second problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yoshikazu, you can solve it here by using the method you just described.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta pointed to the standard answer on the whiteboard and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you want me to do it like this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri&#39;s hand finally moved. Cute handwriting was written on the notebook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Right, next......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, can you save me too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Wait a minute, I&#39;ll finish for Yoshikazu first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That, I can ask later.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri seemed to be a little concerned about Kento.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Go ahead and do it, it&#39;ll be done soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said, &quot;I don&#39;t think he heard me, but he urged Juri to continue with the problem.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada-san, why don&#39;t I teach you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked at Kento&#39;s notebook from the side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento subconsciously shrank back a little.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m hurt that you rejected me like that&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara chided Kento with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This no, I don&#39;t mean to reject&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll teach you then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara pulled the chair over and leaned against Kento, then started to explain to him &quot;Here is the formula......&quot; and wrote the procedure in his notebook at the same time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kento&#39;s shoulders and Sara&#39;s were leaning together, and his whole body froze. He was living like a wooden man, only his eyes were moving following the equation Sara wrote. It was obvious that he was desperately trying to stay calm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time, Juri&#39;s pen stopped. She was still looking at the problem. Her eyes were fixed on the notebook and did not move. But her attention was clearly not on the problem. She was concerned about Sara and Kento&#39;s conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Got it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara tilted her head and looked at Kento&#39;s expression from the bottom to the top.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I... I get it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kento&#39;s voice was a bit panicked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Try it yourself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kento did the problem as Sara taught him. In fact, he did it again according to the formula Sara wrote. In the end, of course, he succeeded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Like this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Look, it&#39;s done. Let&#39;s move on to the next one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This one is too hard, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, look at this one, you have to solve it like this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara wrote in Kento&#39;s notebook again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s how it is. What should I do here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento seemed to have gained a little confidence after solving a problem, and he started to ask questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento started to solve the problem smoothly, while Juri&#39;s pen was still stuck on the second problem and did not move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yoshikazu, is there a problem?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No problem. I can solve it myself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can do it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After one lesson, Kento and Juri were able to do the wrong problems more or less by themselves. However, the interpersonal relationship became more complicated. Sakuta couldn&#39;t do anything about this problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s all for today&#39;s lesson.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta finished the full eighty minutes and left the class on time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, you&#39;ve worked hard~&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento was the first to gather his things and stood up with great vigor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada, you should go back and study hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento was still turning around and ready to leave, when he heard Sakuta&#39;s advice, he turned his head with a reluctant look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;See you at school next week, Yamada-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said so and waved at Kento, who immediately smiled. If he were a dog, he would be wagging his tail right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, aren&#39;t you going?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have to talk to the teacher next about the future of the course.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said as she glanced at Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento started looking for something to talk about, he obviously wanted to talk to Himeji more. But before he could find the right topic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re in my way&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri said this to him, indicating that she wanted to get out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not in your way, I&#39;m just leaving&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result, Kento left without being able to talk to Sara anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, Juri bowed to Sakuta and went out as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sara watched them with an expression that looked like she was holding back a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t make fun of your classmates all the time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said as he erased the equation on the whiteboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you mean Yamada-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara came over and helped him erase it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And Yoshikazu&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When she heard Sakuta say the name, Sara&#39;s hand stopped erasing the whiteboard, and she was erasing next to the rest of the string.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta wiped off the remainder of the string for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t know you cared so much about your students, Sakuta.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be the one who&#39;ll have a big headache if they don&#39;t get good grades.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara erased the last tangent function.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know. I&#39;ll correct it so that Sakuta-sensei doesn&#39;t get a big headache.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sara was obedient. She didn&#39;t look like she was trying to be submissive either. But there was no sense of guilt. But since she said she would &#12302;correct&#12303;, it means she admitted that she did it on purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta sort of understood why Toranosuke was worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;But Yamada-san&#39;s thoughts are not something I can control.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Yamada has control over his own.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I can&#39;t control Yoshikazu-san&#39;s thoughts either.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yoshikazu herself knows how to control it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t expect you to be so indifferent to your students, Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara smiled and said the exact opposite of what she had just said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta started to gather the maker for writing on the whiteboard. Sara handed over the blue pen that was sitting on the edge of the whiteboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Speaking of which, Sakuta-sensei....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He asked rhetorically as he took the pen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did you do the homework I gave you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The voice of the lecturer explaining world history came from the classroom next door. Sakuta and Sara naturally both looked over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s talk somewhere else.

The street in front of Fujisawa Station was illuminated by December lights, looking even more flamboyant than during the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The temperature plummeted at night, and Sakuta and Sara exhaled white air as they walked to the station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, what are you going to do for Christmas this year?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If that dream comes true, I&#39;ll probably go on a date with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not good to lay hands on students.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara jokingly admonished Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But why were we together that day?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How would I know?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t have a clue yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why do you think so?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I think you cheated on me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s the most likely possibility.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can you speak with a little emotion?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The two of them were laughing and joking as they walked up the three-dimensional sidewalk. The coffee shop Sara mentioned was on the second floor of the building across from the Kitaguchi......appliance store.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a store with glass exterior walls and inside were high school students studying and office workers working on their laptops. The seats were half filled. The place was so crowded during the day that it was almost impossible to find a seat. But in the night, the crowds are a little less.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The place makes talking a lot easier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as you enter the store, a warm &quot;welcome&quot; is heard from the clerk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You go ahead and find a seat.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta told Sara to take a seat first, then went to the innermost counter and ordered a cafe latte, a caramel latte, and the new doughnuts, which were only available for the Christmas season. After swiping his IC card, he checked out and picked up his meal at the next counter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When I looked back, I didn&#39;t see Sara. Her bag and jacket were on a seat by the window. Instead, she herself ran to a table closer to the counter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a man and a woman sitting at the table, both dressed in Minegahara High School uniforms. Sara smiled and talked to them, and they both responded cheerfully. But the smiles on both the boys&#39; and girls&#39; faces looked a bit artificial. I could sense anxiety or confusion from them. I don&#39;t know if it was an illusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; Sakuta went to his seat first, and when Sara saw him, she too returned to her seat with a bounce. She drew out her chair with both hands in a regular manner and then sat down directly opposite of him. Her eyes lingered on the doughnut that looked like it was sprinkled with snowflakes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you for your hospitality.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t tell Yamada-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento would say, &quot;My, my, my.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll tell him that if he gets a perfect score on the test, he&#39;ll get a doughnut from the teacher.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be nice if he could study harder. But Sakuta felt sure he would just give up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, no, I feel like Yamada-san would have said, &quot;Forget it,&quot; and given up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems she thinks the same as Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara smiled and took out her phone from her bag and started taking pictures. The pictures were of doughnuts and caramel lattes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said, &quot;So cute,&quot; while clicking the shutter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;You know those two over there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta glanced at those two students from Minegahara High School.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That girl is a friend of mine in class ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked at the girl first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The one with her is a sophomore. He helped me a lot when I was a member of the sports committee.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, she looked at the boy sitting closer to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara met their eyes and waved gently at them. They waved back in return. Then the boys picked up their trays and stood up. It looked like they were leaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They gathered up the used cups and prepared to leave the store. Before they left, Sara&#39;s friend waved to Sara again. It went on until they walked out of sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The boys looked awkward during this time. It was probably not an illusion. It felt like he was in a hurry to get out of here. Of course, it might be because he couldn&#39;t keep up with the two girls emotionally. But it must have been more than this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji, is there a story between you and that boy?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta took a sip of his cafe latte and asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t know you were so sharp, Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara used a fork to cut the doughnut into a bite size and put it in her mouth. Then she exaggerated a bit and said &#39;it&#39;s delicious&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Two months ago, he said he wanted to go out with me&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then she dryly told Sakuta about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So how did you respond to him?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Actually, I could probably tell by their interaction just now. The answer would not be at least yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I said, &quot;I can&#39;t go out with him right now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not yet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I can&#39;t. I didn&#39;t know him at that time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that what you told him?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why he looked so embarrassed. When you get that kind of answer, you mistakenly think you still have a chance. You think there&#39;s a possibility for the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Does your friend know about this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t tell her, but I think she probably does. Girls are very sensitive to this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She knows this, and she still talks to them without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh yeah, they don&#39;t seem to have started dating yet. So I just went to care a little bit, saying that when they start dating they must tell me. But if it were me, I would never go out with a guy who was dumped by a friend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then why don&#39;t you just ignore them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But it&#39;s only been two months, isn&#39;t that a bit too much?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara tried to justify her behavior with this statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Since you don&#39;t have a chance here, it might be wise for him to switch targets quickly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But he&#39;s confessed, and boys just take it so well?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked as if she was saying this incredulously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m the kind of guy who would be torn for a long time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You like to make it sound like you&#39;re bluffing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So do you still like Kasai now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s eyes widened in surprise at the sudden question. Then blinked twice. She seemed to understand the situation in those two short blinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It seems that it was Toranosuke......it was Kasai who said something to you, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She showed a somewhat embarrassed expression, then made a keen deduction. This surprised Sakuta a little too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I heard that you guys were childhood playmates. He&#39;s worried about you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that because he&#39;s guilty? Because he basically dumped me&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara asked Sakuta with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Pretty much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m more worried about him. He has a crush on someone as complicated as Rio-sensei. He&#39;ll be dumped for sure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I do think Kasai is quite attractive.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although he gave off a stereotypical image, he was a dashing basketball player anyway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You see how nice he is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As far as Sakuta&#39;s personal feelings are concerned, this statement is still quite superficial. But before, Yuuma also said that Toranosuke was a good person. Toranosuke trusted Yuuma and came to Sakuta. And Sakuta could trust Yuuma too. This trustworthy person said Toranosuke was a trustworthy person, so there was nothing wrong with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;He is really nice. Even after he dumped me, he still cares about me&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara made a sarcastic remark with a little bit of pretense. The statement revealed that she didn&#39;t want to easily admit that Toranosuke was nice. But Toranosuke did dump Sara, so it&#39;s appropriate to take a complaint or two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sara was able to joke about the memory, and he didn&#39;t feel any love for Toranosuke from her. That&#39;s why Sakuta didn&#39;t even think it was necessary to ask her what she thought now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;But I became super annoyed with him after I found out that it wasn&#39;t me he liked&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She made a bitter smile that perfectly hid her shyness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;As you probably already know, before I started high school, everyone thought that I was boyfriend and girlfriend with Kasai&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I did know&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There were a lot of girls who liked Kasai back then, but everyone seemed to think that I was the only one who deserved to be with him. I felt pretty good at the time and was very proud of myself. But when I got to high school......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I found out that Kasai liked someone else&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toranosuke said it was the first time he realized the feeling of being in love.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was really devastated. I had always thought that Kasai liked me, and everyone around me was saying, &#39;You two are perfect for each other&#39; ...... but it was all an illusion. At that time, I already had doubts about the world. Whether it was my own thoughts, the words of people around me, or the world I had seen so far, it could all be wrong......When I noticed this, I was really scared. I thought I didn&#39;t even dare to leave the door because I thought everyone might be laughing at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that the Golden Week you were talking about earlier?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But adolescent syndrome gets rid of those jitters.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At least that&#39;s what she said herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that why you&#39;ve been so popular lately?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, it seems you&#39;re really taking your homework seriously.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Who told me to care so much about my students?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But you&#39;ve got the wrong answer. My symptoms are not that I&#39;m loved by everyone. To be honest, I&#39;ve been feeling a bit flattered lately.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you&#39;re happy now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta knew the answer without her having to answer. Her glowing expression said it all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If I say &#39;yes,&#39; I&#39;ll be a bad girl.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think that&#39;s fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This &#39;good&#39; is not a compliment, is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even when she was talking about this, she looked happy. A happy thing can make everything happy. Sakuta felt the aura of a virtuous circle from her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By what I just said, I already know that you object to me being loved by everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not against it. It&#39;s just that I want to say that no matter how many more confessions you get, how many dozens more sweet words you hear, and how many hundreds more people chase you......you won&#39;t get what you really want.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;.....What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s expression was not as happy and smiling as it was a moment ago and became somewhat puzzled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m happy now. There&#39;s nothing in particular that I want.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked into Sakuta&#39;s eyes without looking away and demanded an answer from him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara had never said the single most important thing in the conversation she had just had. She had said something about Toranosuke&#39;s feelings for her, and another about one of his friends around him, but not a word about her own thoughts. The question that Sakuta asked her at the beginning of the conversation, she also did not answer positively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Is Sara still in love with Toranosuke?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara didn&#39;t give an answer to that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think there is a feeling that makes you happy when being pursued by many people.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What kind of feeling?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s see, let&#39;s say......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said while thinking of Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are some people who make you feel happy as long as she&#39;s around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If she even smiled at him, he would be even happier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to be with her forever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s how much Mai is in Sakuta&#39;s heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The happiest thing for me......is that the person I like the most also likes me the most&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta thought of her while calmly saying his thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He is able to say this now because he has already experienced too much. There is nothing in it to add fuel to the fire. Nor was there any embarrassment. It was just a thought from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In the worst case scenario, I would not want anything else as long as I could be with her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara stared at Sakuta and even forgot to blink. The smile she had just had was gone from her face. These words were so strange to her that she didn&#39;t know how to react.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let me ask you again, do you still like Kasai now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara didn&#39;t answer. Probably, she didn&#39;t have an answer in her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta had a feeling about it. At first, when Sara said she was &#39;dumped&#39;, Sakuta felt something was wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That day or today......Sara had never complained.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#39;t say how sad she was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#39;t say how much pain she was in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nor did she say how many times she cried about it......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not a single word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The only description she gives of it is &#39;devastated&#39;. But the reason for that is also that Toranosuke&#39;s feelings were different from what she thought. What the people around her said was off the mark. She believed those words, but ended up falling for that trap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The fundamental question is, did you ever like Kasai?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you trying to say that I&#39;m the same as Kasai?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think you are alike.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She also had a stereotype because people around her said they were a good match, so she kept thinking that way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Then please tell me&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was silent for a moment before she made up her mind to open her mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up at Sakuta with a provocative look in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How do I be like you, and fall in love with someone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the correct answer Sara gave to the question Sakuta gave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.7pe7kh97cqdb"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.cgcu8isxiv6u"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.9mv9e5kojxpr"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.wt5d61g7gliz"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.u4f4ruiyckop"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.1mvt56kk6675"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.p0qv6fqtneob"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.pwvm7u61yi41"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.syig83z29c2r"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c1 c4" id="h.a27jlz4vqy8d"><span class="c5"></span></h2><h2 class="c2 c4" id="h.w0825klbwukg"><span class="c5">Chapter 3: I need you</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, so Sakuta is going to teach her to fall in love by the hand and the waist&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai pierced the salad with her fork.

It was the look of a perverted cram school tutor. But she immediately returned to normal...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, but I do have some feelings about it. I sometimes wonder what exactly constitutes &#39;like&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Mito picked up the whole steak with a spoon and put it in her mouth, biting the skin on the outside of the steak with a loud clack. Even Sakuta could hear it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you like fried steak curry rice?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said, and took another piece.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then isn&#39;t that &#39;like&#39;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After Sakuta&#39;s testimony, Mito beamed in displeasure. Although her eyes wanted to slash someone, she kept on chewing the cutlet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After chewing it several times, she swallowed it with a gulp, and then served a glass of water. After waiting for a long time, she opened her mouth and the first thing she said was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you like about Azusagawa-kun, Mai-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, that&#39;s a good question!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta looked at Mai with an expectant expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid Mito was trying to use Mai as a retort to what Sakuta had just said. She must have wanted Mai to teach Sakuta a lesson. However, she was wrong in this thought. Whether Mai answered her question seriously or chose to scold Sakuta, it was a reward for Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With the two of them looking at each other...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I like the fact that he&#39;s &#39;super into me&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori&#39;s hands stopped eating the curry. She probably didn&#39;t expect such an answer from Mai. The spoon stopped in mid-air.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Indeed, Truth&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mito put the spoon back into the curry and made an exclamatory sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She seemed to have been so shocked by Mai&#39;s words that she forgot her original purpose and kept repeating in a low voice, &quot;I see, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mito, Why don&#39;t you ask me what you like about Mai?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t have to ask you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, Mai&#39;s cell phone on the table rang, and she answered it immediately.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, no problem. Okay, I&#39;ll go now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She hung up and put the phone in her bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ryoko-san is here to pick me up, I have to go now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have a job next, Mai-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mito asked the question. Sakuta knew about it beforehand. It seemed to be a commercial for some kind of make-up that sells transparency. It&#39;s a good match for Mai&#39;s style.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. I&#39;ll see you later, then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai smiled and stood up after telling Miori.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll return the dishes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you. Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai picked up her bag and waved her right hand with the ring on it around her waist, making a gesture of &quot;bye&quot; and walking out of the school cafeteria.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After seeing Mai off, Sakuta took another cup of tea and spent some time in the cafeteria where there were no more students. During this time, he also talked more with Mito about his student, Sara, who had just become a topic of conversation. Sara, the student who had just become the topic of conversation. Of course, he didn&#39;t talk about puberty syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After a general explanation of the situation, Sakuta and the others left the cafeteria to catch the university classes that started at one o&#39;clock. They walked to the school building, which was about a hundred meters away from the cafeteria.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She&#39;s really good&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Your student.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You mean her ability to handle boys?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Rather, she was enjoying the jealousy from the other girls?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t you enjoy it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed to Sakuta that Miori must be popular too. Just by being with her, she could feel the eyes of the male students. This feeling naturally affects the girls around her as well. And this naturally waved to trigger the jealousy of those girls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">At the seminar meeting where she met Miori, the male student that her friend had her eye on was interested in her and kept trying to exchange contact information with her. To escape this embarrassment, she even escaped to Sakuta&#39;s table to avoid this embarrassment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of this incident, her friend&#39;s relationship with her became a bit delicate for a while. Maybe they are still delicate now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t enjoy people who are clearly upset with me but feel they can&#39;t compete with me and admit defeat without permission. People who don&#39;t want to leave me because they can get something out of being around me just make me feel like, &quot;This person is so annoying.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The tone of her voice is very flat, but the words she says are very sharp. Her strength lies in her ability to make these words less harsh. It&#39;s a natural way of thinking that people will agree with her, and it&#39;s really her style.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;However, there must be a sense of superiority.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I see, a sense of superiority.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thinks that a sense of superiority is not necessarily a negative thing. Superiority and self-confidence are next to each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Perhaps Himeji-san&#39;s sense of superiority is more important than her other feelings.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It means that she likes herself so much. She likes herself more than others.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miori was just saying that. That&#39;s the tone of her voice. But her words were like an enlightenment that made Sakuta wake up instantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Those words just now seemed to describe Sara&#39;s heart very precisely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tomoe had also said before - she didn&#39;t like Sara very much, who must have been popular since middle school. Because Sara was different from Tomoe who was trying to become beautiful by entering high school. Tomoe said this with a sense of inferiority. She says this with a sense of inferiority. It was as if she thought she was a fake and Sara was the real thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s cheerful and active personality is not pretentious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no heart behind her kind of affability either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#39;t tease Kento with malice either. At least not in a way that made people feel malicious. Sakuta himself didn&#39;t feel any malice anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara is also used to getting kindness from others.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So she acts more naturally than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Such words and actions have become a part of her as a person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no sense of pushing through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no feeling of pretending.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps, this is the kind of demeanor that only someone who has been a central air conditioner since childhood can develop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">According to Toranosuke, Sara had been in the spotlight from kindergarten to elementary school to junior high school. This was a daily routine for her. Being a crane was taken for granted for her, so much so that she didn&#39;t even have any doubt about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, this person who was doted on by everyone in the class as the central figure and who lived a fuller life than everyone else in the class unknowingly encountered a huge setback.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To her, it was logical that others would be kind to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;All she had to do was accept the kindness given to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Being jealous was not surprising, it was even a stimulus that would inspire her self-esteem and confidence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;For her, having grown up in this environment, she prefers being liked by someone else than to like someone else herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori hit the nail on the head with a single sentence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The popular Mito, who says things differently.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I am what I am, a different kind of firework.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori puffed out her chest proudly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll ask you again, what do you think I should do?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You mean that cute schoolgirl of yours?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She deliberately emphasized &#39;cute&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right, that cute girl.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t shrink. Sara was in fact cute. He was just stating the facts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then just do what she said and make her someone who can like people just like you can?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How would you do that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Make her like you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;After saying that, Miori couldn&#39;t hold back her laughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s a good idea&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta replied in a bad mood. That was the kind of reaction Miori wanted to see from him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I won&#39;t tell Mai-san about this for now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;The proof was that she looked happier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I really must thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Seriously, you should be careful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Miori looked over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Be careful of what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That you don&#39;t follow in the footsteps of others - don&#39;t become the third cram school tutor?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Halfway through, she started laughing alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I only have Mai-san in my heart.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really? But you&#39;ve been talking about that cute girl so far today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Very sharp.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Isn&#39;t that exactly what she wants, Azusagawa-sensei?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Very sharp indeed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Without realizing it, Sakuta may have already started to follow in the footsteps of others. If we don&#39;t stop now, the result could be even worse. Just thinking about it makes me think that this is no joke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll be careful&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After receiving Mito&#39;s perfect advice, Sakuta went to the school building. The 1:00 noon class was about to begin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Two days later, on Wednesday, December 14. After attending classes at the university until 4 p.m., Sakuta declined the invitation to Takumi&#39;s social meeting and went straight back to Fujisawa Station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He did not go to the apartment where he lived, but to the cram school located in the opposite direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;By the time he arrived at the cram school, it was already 5:30. After putting his things away and changing his clothes, Sakuta quickly went to the staff office to prepare for today&#39;s lesson.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He prepared test questions for Kento and Juri to review their previous knowledge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;For Sara, he found a few questions for the university entrance exam level. First, questions on the difficulty of the general exam, and then from past exams of famous schools - when he felt the sight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he looked up, he found Juri looking at him from the other side of the counter, the dividing line between the public area and the faculty area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That one, Azusagawa-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She also called out Sakuta&#39;s name after meeting the line of sight. It seemed that Sakuta was concentrating on his work just now, so she couldn&#39;t disturb him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yoshikazu-san. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri rarely initiated conversation. He stood up and walked to the counter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can you change the time of the tutorial scheduled for this Saturday?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there something scheduled?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s a beach volleyball tournament. I forgot to tell you. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Even in this season?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When you think of beach volleyball, you think of the summer sun, white sand, wheat skin and colorful swimsuits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We were supposed to play in September, but it was postponed due to a typhoon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now it&#39;s December.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re going to Okinawa.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is it so warm there?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I think the photos Shoko sent me a while ago showed that she was still wearing summer clothes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s not really true. After all, it&#39;s winter, so most players wear jackets.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sand volleyball has jackets?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m learning new things one after another. Sakuta thought it was a summer sport only.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, I get it. Go for it!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So when&#39;s the cram session?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at the calendar on the wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have any plans for December 23rd?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, you can. Then the 23rd.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After saying what needed to be said, there was silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri stared wordlessly at the calendar, not wanting to leave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What else?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Satkua&#39;s question caused her to jerk her shoulders sensitively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Uh, that, I have a good friend&ndash;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her voice was so low that she couldn&#39;t hear her eyes still wandered over to the calendar. She didn&#39;t even care to look at the calendar, her consciousness was completely focused elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, this friend you&#39;re talking about&ndash;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I... had a dream about this friend who got dumped. That person confessed to the person he liked ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, &#39;#dreaming&#39; is very popular these days.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, what do you think I should do at a time like this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you talking about Yamada-san and Himeji-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not affirming nor denying. She showed an expression of pure shock. Because she was so surprised, she couldn&#39;t even speak. But she looked as if she was asking, &quot;How did you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, Yamada-san is too easy to understand.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This time, Juri still didn&#39;t affirm or deny. She showed a somewhat troubled but somewhat angry expression. Or maybe she was just trying desperately to calm herself down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But isn&#39;t that good for you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... How can it be good. The person you like is being played by that nasty woman&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The emotion in Juri&#39;s eyes was stronger than the one in her voice. It was a resignation, an anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re so angry, then charm Yamada-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri said conclusively. She completely dismissed any possibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s no way I can win over Himeji-san .....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her voice was so low that she couldn&#39;t even hear it, and her eyes looked down - no, further down, at the ground by her feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara is very popular with the boys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Juri wasn&#39;t without a chance of winning. At least Sakuta didn&#39;t think Juri had to be so pessimistic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I hope you won&#39;t get angry and hear me out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;.....What did you say?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri raised her eyes slightly, and there was already some dissatisfaction in her words. She shouldn&#39;t be mad at Sakuta, but because they were talking about topics that annoyed her and that put her in a bad mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And meeting Sakuta&#39;s eyes with meaningful anticipation, she clutched the edge of the counter with both hands, waiting with nervousness for Sakuta&#39;s next words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think if you show Yamada-san your swimsuit tan, he&#39;ll surrender&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no reaction for the moment after saying that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She probably hadn&#39;t understood what Sakuta was saying. Her expression didn&#39;t change, she just blinked her eyes several times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally she looked away as if she had understood the meaning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta was expecting to be scolded, but Juri said something like this in a soft, confirming voice. She raised her eyes to look at him, and a hopeful glint began to appear in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This wave may have given the wrong advice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I really think so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But having said that, it was impossible to turn back. Sakuta didn&#39;t feel that he had lied either. Then there was only one thing to do - go all the way to the dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri was thoughtfully silent. Sakuta wanted to ask her what she was thinking at that moment, but time didn&#39;t allow&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello, everyone...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A voice that wasn&#39;t small but had no energy came through. It was Kento.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, hello Sakuta-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri didn&#39;t look at Kento at all. She kept her back turned to him. So Kento couldn&#39;t even see Juri&#39;s red face now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now that everyone is here. Then we can start the lesson&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm? Is Himeji-san already in the classroom?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento, who didn&#39;t know anything yet, blurted out the name. At that moment, Juri clutched her bag with both hands. I can&#39;t help it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I had a different class schedule for Himeji-san, so I staggered the time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh? Oh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento put his hands in his pants pockets as if he didn&#39;t care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Go wait in class, I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are we going to do today, Sakuta?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;First of all, I&#39;m going to review what we&#39;ve done before.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t want to see sin and cos anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And Tan.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re killing me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kento complained as he walked into the classroom. Juri was staring at him with indignation behind his back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The 80-minute class that started at 6:00 p.m. ended at 7:40 p.m on the dot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Thank you for your hard work, Yamada. That&#39;s all for today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Finally, it&#39;s over. It&#39;s too long for a cram school class, isn&#39;t it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was longer than one class in high school. It feels like it&#39;s twice as long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &quot;You&#39;ll have to enjoy 90-minute classes when you go to college.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m definitely not going to college. I&#39;ve decided, I won&#39;t go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento flopped down on the table helplessly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, by the way, Yamada-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The only thing Kento did was to lift his head up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I change my Saturday class to December 23rd?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh? Really? I can take Saturday off?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s just a different day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m missing a class. But it seems to be a big deal for Kento to have this week off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s the reason?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yoshikazu and her classmates are going to Okinawa for a competition.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, is it a national competition?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento suddenly said to Juri, who was packing her pens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s great. You&#39;re only a freshman in high school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s normal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Anyway, go for it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Juri, who was suddenly cheered up, froze. Then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, I&#39;ll do my best.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She responded well and unexpectedly. After saying it, she thought she shouldn&#39;t answer, so she looked around in a panic. Her eyes were so wide that they were about to fall out. Luckily, Kento, who was lying on the table, wasn&#39;t even looking at her. Even so, she said, &quot;I&#39;ll go first,&quot; and fled from the classroom. She didn&#39;t even put on her coat and took her school bag with her and ran away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Kento were the only ones left in the classroom. Kento was lying on his desk, showing no sign of leaving.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why aren&#39;t you leaving?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Usually he was the first to leave, making it seem like he didn&#39;t want to stay in this crappy cram school for even a second. Today, however, was different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That, teacher&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, is she dating anyone?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re in her class, shouldn&#39;t you know better than me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think so......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Does she have someone he likes?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;you might as well ask her directly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking Sakuta-sensei. Can you ask her for me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I refuse.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento continued to fold his hands to Sakuta in a lying position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, a figure entered the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, are you still in class?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was none other than Sara, whom they had talked about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She looked back and forth at Kento, who was worshipping Sakuta, and Sakuta, who was being worshipped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Doesn&#39;t it look like you&#39;re in class?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She asked with a smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada-san says he has something to ask you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey! Sakuta-sensei!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento scrambled to his feet. He stood straight up because he was so fierce.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yamada-san, what&#39;s the matter?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, it&#39;s not a big deal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then ask. I&#39;ll be concerned if you do that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento was instantly moved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uh, it&#39;s......Christmas soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento actually started from that point. Has he really thought about how he should express himself? I&#39;m afraid not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There are a lot of men and women who have started dating at school lately.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, that&#39;s a bit anxious, isn&#39;t it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was just talking to Sakuta about whether Himeji-san is dating anyone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He was just talking to Sakuta about whether you were dating anyone. And at this point, he brought up Sakuta. I&#39;m afraid he couldn&#39;t bear the sight of Sara looking at him during the conversation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although Sakuta, who was caught up in it, was baffled, Kento made a good effort overall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Kento made a huge mistake. If asked in that way, Sara would have had a very sharp comeback.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then why would Yamada-san bother with such things?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh? Why?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento had given up confronting Sara. He winked at Sakuta with a &#39;help me now&#39; look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta had no choice but to help.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, if Himeji-san has a lover, there will be no classes on Christmas Day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Aren&#39;t you the one who doesn&#39;t want to attend classes on Christmas Day, Sakuta-sensei?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just as he thought, Sara started to turn the conversation to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. I definitely don&#39;t want to.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sensei, who is more important, us or our lovers?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s the lover, of course.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t say that even if you think it. And you&#39;re saying it with such a straight face.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When Sakuta replied seriously, Sara smiled and reprimanded him, pretending to be angry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, teacher&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento joined in the attack on Sakuta in order to get away from that topic. He put on his coat in a very natural way and got ready to go home. I hope he will return the favor afterwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll leave now, then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento said that to him and Sara and started to walk out of the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, Yamada-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara called out to Kento.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uh, what?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He couldn&#39;t help but turn around after his name was clearly called. His expression was still stiff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not dating anyone, but I have someone I care about.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento kept his head turned to look this way and froze with his mouth open. He tried to say something, but closed his mouth again and ended up making a little strange moaning sound. It wasn&#39;t a language that humans could understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s all. See you later.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kento, who was waved goodbye by Sara, also subconsciously raised one hand and said something vague like &quot;Ah. Okay,&quot; he said with a vague meaning. Finally, he wandered out of the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Sara were the only two people left in the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara sat down in her seat as if nothing had happened, took out her pencil case and notebook, and then looked up in response to Sakuta&#39;s gaze.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think it was Sakuta-sensei&#39;s fault for making me talk about that kind of topic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to say anything about you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But you&#39;re looking at me like you&#39;re saying, &quot;She&#39;s doing it again.&quot;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, I&#39;m just saying you&#39;re good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You mean good, &quot;in a way?&quot;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;In every kind of way.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then in today&#39;s class, Sakuta-sensei will tell me what I should do in this situation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then please solve this problem first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta put two pages of questions on the table.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The first one was a question for the general examination level. The second one is a question from a prestigious school for self-admission. They are all questions related to quadratic functions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If I solve these problems, can I become like Sakuta and like other people?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Solve these problems and I will understand how good you are now. The time limit is 40 minutes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta showed the timer to Sara and pressed the start button.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara, who seemed to have something to say, started solving the questions as soon as she heard the beep. This does have the feel of a serious honors student. Only she still pouted, showing her displeasure with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;During this time of waiting, Sakuta also started to do the problem. There is no way to explain if you can&#39;t even do it yourself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first question was the unified examination level. This question was solved successfully for all three sub-questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Then it was a past test question from a prestigious school. This was not so simple. He had read the reference answers when choosing the questions and thought he had fully understood them. But when he really had to solve it himself, he thought he didn&#39;t know what he was talking about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you can&#39;t solve it, you&#39;ll embarrass yourself, so Sakuta too reaches for the reference book. While staring at the answers, the time kept passing. Finally, the 40 minute bell rang before the solution was finished.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara let out a breath and dropped her pen. She put her hands on her knees as if the exam was over, and her expression was grave.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How was it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I only solved the first two questions.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were five questions this time. There were three questions on the unified exam and two on the prestigious school exam.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s good enough to solve two questions now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was still a freshman in high school, two years away from the real entrance exam.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta looked at the answers Sara had written in her notebook, and the two questions she said she had &#39;solved&#39; were indeed the correct answers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The third question was even a trap question. Sara had been tricked by the questioner into answering in the wrong direction. It seems that in the process of solving the question, she realized that she had made a mistake, but there was no time to solve the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The answer to the question is &quot;What is the correct answer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s start with the third question, then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta wrote out the standard answer on the whiteboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The moment he wrote out the first equation...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, so that&#39;s the formula.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara let out a gasp of surprise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She immediately realized that she had made a mistake somewhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right. It has nothing to do with this function here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As long as you don&#39;t fall for it at first, you will be able to solve the problem with a very simple calculation. It was more of a language test than a math test.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The clever thing about this trap question is that there are several questions that look like it that require the same kind of solution as the one written in Sara&#39;s notebook, also known as a &#39;conventional problem&#39;. So the more you accumulate experience in solving those kinds of problems, the more likely you are to fall into this trap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This problem is just like Sakuta.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;d rather be kinder than this one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I like Saukta-sensei&#39;s cheeky attitude.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then look at the next question.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &quot;Please don&#39;t ignore students&#39; confessions&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t hate this part of you either.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s eyes widened in surprise at Sakuta&#39;s words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t bother with her, but turned his back to draw the graph of the quadratic function on the blackboard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d be a little worried if you had the same attitude towards others&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;.....What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right. That&#39;s the right way to think about it. It looks like a simple y=x, but it&#39;s actually very tricky.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not asking about the math, but about the meaning of what you just said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta stopped and looked back at Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked at Sakuta too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What should I say next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked at Sakuta, who was struggling with what to say, and a smile appeared at the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, a familiar figure walked through the classroom - it was Rio.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, Rio, wait!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta called out to Rio, and she came back to the classroom door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Come here for a minute.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta beckoned her over. She walked into the classroom with a questioning look on her face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Aren&#39;t you still in class?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She glanced at Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t understand this question, so please explain it to me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;As a cram school teacher, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio looked at the problem Sakuta handed her and after about thirty seconds of thinking, she erased the diagram he had drawn on the whiteboard with her opposite hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She drew the functions and wrote the equations from scratch, explaining the meaning of each diagram and each equation very clearly on the way. She did not omit or skip steps, but wrote each step very carefully and clearly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The puzzle that Sakuta couldn&#39;t figure out in twenty minutes was solved by Rio in five minutes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After solving it, the whiteboard was full of diagrams and equations.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you get it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After putting the cap on the marker, she looked back at her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I see.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta answered before Sara did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;While she was solving the problem, Sakuta sat next to Sara and listened to the lesson together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t ask you&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio replied in a bad mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara nodded slowly and gave an exclamation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve got it all figured out. The explanation was very clear and easy to understand.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, I guess you&#39;re not bad at anything other than math, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio and Sara both looked at Sakuta who suddenly asked this question. It was a look of surprise and confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not really, bad ......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara gave a modest answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What is the average of the first semester&#39;s grades?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Between &#39;8&#39; and &#39;9&#39;, I think.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s even better than Sakuta expected. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s mostly &quot;8&quot; or &quot;9&quot;, with a few &quot;10&quot; or &quot;7&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess. Sakuta couldn&#39;t even think about it. But the report card of Mai in high school was probably at that level.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think if you find a good teacher now, it won&#39;t be hard for you to get into a good school at once, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Noticing the intention of Sakuta&#39;s words, Rio looked at him with some annoyance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Rio is a better teacher than me. Himeji-san, you think so too, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The harder the question, the more obvious the gap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, it might be better if you let Rio teach you.....&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Sakuta could say the word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I only want Sakuta-sensei to teach me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Sara interrupted him with words full of urgency and emotion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The voice was not loud, but it was very firm. The atmosphere in the classroom instantly froze into ice, the kind of ice that breaks at the slightest touch. A bad feeling was beginning to come over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Rio showed a somewhat surprised expression. Sakuta was also surprised inwardly. Because it was the first time he had seen Sara show her true heart like that......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the one who was most surprised was definitely Sara herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was surprised that she could say such things impulsively.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was surprised that her emotions would spill out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was surprised that she seemed to have made a louder noise than she expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What happened? Is everything all right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The principal of the cram school poked his head out from behind the doorway. He was making his inspection of the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The principal saw Sara&#39;s back first, and then looked at Sakuta with some distress. There was a slight tension in his expression. Because he knew that Sakuta was already the third teacher in charge of taking Sara. He knew exactly what had happened to the first two teachers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry. There was a question that I didn&#39;t understand very well, so I asked Rio-sensei to help me with it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara also nodded her head and answered &quot;Yes&quot;. Then Rio responded to the principal with a short &#39;yes&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was silence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first to break the silence was the timer bell that announced the end of the class. The bell wasn&#39;t very loud, but it was enough to make Sara move.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you for your guidance today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara lowered her head, put her notebook and pencil case in her bag, and picked up her coat...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll take care of you next time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She bowed her head and saluted, and left the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The principal seemed to want to talk to her, but finally refrained from calling out to her. Then the principal turned to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this okay?......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He asked an extremely vague question. It was hard to tell what exactly he wanted to ask is okay. But the principal was so vague because the situation was difficult to talk about.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta also answered very vaguely &quot;It&#39;s fine&quot;. Although there was no substance to it, it was at least a formal way to put an end to the matter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anyway, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After that, the principal left - the sound of his footsteps could not even be heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This time, it was Sakuta and Rio who stayed in the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio took a deep breath and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you want?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her tone could even be described as a stern rebuke to Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re making her angry on purpose, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although she was asking the question to him, she was already sure of the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She wanted a good explanation from Sakuta because she was involved.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In terms of results, I&#39;m doing this to protect Mai.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything Sakuta did was for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You mean that information? The one about finding Touko Kirishima and Sakurajima in danger?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You said before that there were only two possibilities, right? Either Kirishima Touko directly harmed Mai, or the patient of the adolescent syndrome caused by Kirishima Touko put Mai in danger. But the former is less likely&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After meeting with Touko, Sakuta came to the same conclusion as Rio had said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then narrow it down to the latter......So, Azusagawa, do you already understand what her adolescent syndrome is?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I still don&#39;t understand it at all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Then I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re trying to say either.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio also frowned for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know what her adolescent syndrome is yet. But I think I know why she has adolescent syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, Rio must have understood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Oh, I see. It&#39;s true that this is very much your style. Anyway, you just want to cure her heart without knowing the symptoms of her syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Isn&#39;t that a good idea?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;All the adolescent syndromes I&#39;ve encountered so far have been clearly linked to the syndrome in the mind. The root of the problem is there. So, if we only think about &quot;curing&quot;, what kind of supernatural phenomena would be caused by Sara&#39;s adolescent syndrome?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The supernatural phenomena that Sara&#39;s adolescent syndrome would cause were not important. We just need to solve Sara&#39;s psychological problem directly. All roads lead to Rome, and there is not a single solution to get the right answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then you don&#39;t have to bully a girl who is only in her first year of high school. Are you still an adult?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, maybe I&#39;ll be hated.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But isn&#39;t that what you&#39;re trying to do? But she.....you achieved what you wanted, but I think her reaction was a little too violent.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yeah, thanks to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I told you about Himeji-san&#39;s adolescent syndrome, didn&#39;t I?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The thing about being dumped?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, she was actually dumped by Kasai.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio was speechless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel her anger in Rio&#39;s calm words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In the future, can you tell me before you get me involved?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Will you help me if I say so?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I will never help in a situation like this one.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s why Sakuta didn&#39;t say anything. And there really wasn&#39;t much of a chance to say anything this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; The next day, Thursday. It was raining when Sakuta woke up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The sunny and dry winter that had lasted for a little while had finally brought rain. The temperature was the same as yesterday, but somehow warmer. Maybe it was because the humidity had come up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the temperature will plummet again starting the weekend this rain ends. The host of the weather program in winter clothes said, &quot;It&#39;s going to be really cold next week.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The Christmas in the dream world was really cold.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thought about that while taking his umbrella out of the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Other than the rain, I didn&#39;t find anything special on the way. The state of Fujisawa Station in the morning, the crowdedness of the Tokaido Line, and the bustle of Yokohama Station where the transfer took place ...... were all the same as usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing has changed from yesterday, the day before, or a week ago, all the familiar sights and people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The only change is that after changing from Yokohama Station to the Keikyu Line, the train with the distinctive acceleration sound is no longer audible. It was quite rare, so you felt like you had won the lottery when you got on it. But now, even the last remaining single carriage train has been removed, so there is one less thing to be excited about when going to school in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The whole society and the whole world seems to be unchanged, but it is changing little by little.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The second half of the semester is coming to an end, and every class is talking about the final paper or announcing that there will be a final exam in January next year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Today&#39;s first class, the first foreign language (English) ended up being a written and listening test. The second class, a seminar for a large class, was for a final report. The third class is a mathematics class that is designed to provide a foundation for the study of statistics, and is naturally assessed by a written exam. The fourth class was a computer class, and the final project was to create a website.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After the computer class, I heard people talking, &quot;What should I do with this assignment?&quot; &quot;When will you do it?&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not due until next year, it&#39;s a piece of cake!&quot; You can hear conversations like that everywhere. I don&#39;t think anyone is going to</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;hand it in right now. The classroom had a pleasant and relaxed atmosphere, and we all slipped out quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the corridor, there were people saying, &quot;I&#39;m hungry, let&#39;s go eat first. &quot;I don&#39;t have any money to eat.&quot; The voices of a small group of people who quickly changed the subject were heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At the same time, Sakuta was still facing the computer, putting &quot;Mai Sakurajima&quot; and &quot;#dreaming&quot; together in a search.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If someone could dream of something bad happening to Mai, that information would be a natural clue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was because Mai was a famous person that I could use this trick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But just like the previous times, he didn&#39;t see any valuable information left on the SNS today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then Sakuta added &quot;Kirishima Touko&quot; to the search.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because if there was any new information about Touko, maybe he could understand why he had to &quot;find Kirishima Touko&quot;......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, there were still no new clues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The only thing I found was an unfounded speculation that &quot;Mai Sakurajima&quot; was &quot;Touko Kirishima&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;The song is similar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;The voice of humming in the Japanese drama is very similar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;It is said that the official announcement will be made soon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;People on the internet are so full of nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;How can Mai be Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was very clear that they are two different people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But he was surprised that there was a group of people who believed in such a theory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If they hadn&#39;t actually met them, like Sakuta had, believing in this theory might not be so far fetched. If they had no interest in the matter, they would just say, &quot;Oh, is that right?&quot; and accept it as true. To them, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s true or not, it doesn&#39;t matter to those who are not interested.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is how so many outrageous rumors and hearsay spread in the world, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa, what are you checking out?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi, who remained by his side without saying a word, suddenly spoke to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m looking into some troublesome matters.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s hard to explain it all, so Sakuta just summarized it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That must be a lot of trouble.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi just laughed and didn&#39;t break the ice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So what are you looking at?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi had been staring intently at the computer screen for some time now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Isn&#39;t there a beauty contest for boys and girls at the school festival?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think so.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was at the beginning of last month, and a month had passed since then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t go to the pageant herself, but only knew that the members of Wagana&#39;s Sweet Bullet made a guest appearance, and then presented trophies to the winning girls and boys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This website is introducing the winners of all generations.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So you&#39;re looking at which girl is the prettiest?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s true that boys tend to do that. If a few people look at it together, there&#39;s a lot of discussion like &quot;She&#39;s my girl&quot; and &quot;I&#39;d definitely choose her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s what I wanted to do. But I found a strange thing. I didn&#39;t see any introduction of Ms. Yokota last year, but I did see Mr. Yokota.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think Ms is on this page, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, she is Ms.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, you&#39;re the one who started it, Azusagawa.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can you not ignore me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta continued to ignore Takumi and resumed his search for information about Kirishima Touko. At that moment, the table he put his hand on began to vibrate slightly. It was Takumi&#39;s cell phone on the table that was vibrating and sliding up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking at the phone screen, it was a name that he knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ryohei Kotani, a sophomore in the international business department who had gone to the sorority together earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello, what is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi answered the phone cheerfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s someone who can&#39;t come to today&#39;s party, are you coming, Fukuyama?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it was because the volume was turned up too high. Even Sakuta could hear what was being said on the other side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll go, I&#39;ll go, of course I&#39;ll go!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He answered without thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh? Then I&#39;ll send you the details later.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay, thank you very much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi ended the call neatly. He quickly stood up and put on his coat and bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be off then.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi waved goodbye to Sakuta as he was leaving the classroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Your computer&#39;s still on&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can turn it off for me!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Takumi&#39;s voice came from outside the hallway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta prayed that Takumi, who was going straight to the classroom without even knowing who he was going to join, would be safe and sound, while reaching out with his mouse to turn off Takumi&#39;s computer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, his hand jerked to a halt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He stared straight at the screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the winner of last year&#39;s beauty pageant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Takumi said it was the only winner without a profile, but it wasn&#39;t as such.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s just that Takumi couldn&#39;t see it......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s just that Takumi couldn&#39;t perceive the profile -</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had long black hair and wore an innocent white shirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She who showed a somewhat shy smile to the camera...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It is the mini-skirt Santa Claus that you can occasionally see in college.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at the profile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;An unfamiliar name appeared at the top of the profile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Iwamizawa Nene......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That means Kirishima Touko is just a pen name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was a sophomore last year, so that means she&#39;s a junior now. If she is a freshman, she is two years older than Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her major is International Education, the same major as Mai and Nodoka.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Born in Hokkaido, her birthday is March 30, and she is 161cm tall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the end of the information on the profile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This unexpected gain made him excited. This extremely rare coincidence made his heart beat faster. But when he thought about it calmly, he now only knew her real name, her major, her year of study, her place of origin, her birthday, and her height.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;These are all superficial information. It is impossible to see her real self through these.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even so, they were still clues to her identity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta typed the keyword &quot;Iwamizawa Nene&quot; on the keyboard with anticipation and pressed the search button...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After searching for &quot;Iwamizawa Nene&quot; for about an hour or so, Sakuta finally shut down his computer. It was now past six o&#39;clock.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He walked out of the school building along the corridor where he could hear his footsteps. The sky, already overcast from the rain, was now dark. The boulevard, illuminated by streetlights, was already enveloped in the atmosphere of night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But there were still some students walking along the boulevard, and there were also students in white coats who passed by Sakuta who was planning to go home. I&#39;m afraid they were senior students who were working on their graduation projects. They were carrying convenience store bags with instant noodles and plastic bottles of coffee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta wondered if he would be going through this period in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As he thought about this, he walked to the station and got on an express train.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After about 20 minutes of shaking on the Keikyu line, Sakuta, like a large number of other passengers, got off at Yokohama station and changed to the Tokaido line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was another 20 minutes on the Tokaido line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was after 7:00 p.m. when he arrived at Fujisawa Station, and many commuters were walking through it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He grumbled about the winter rain that continued to fall, while walking home with his umbrella.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He kept thinking on the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Several new pieces of information had come to light today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;First. The first thing I saw after searching for &#39;Iwamizawa Nene&#39; was her own SNS account. It was an SNS where you could post photos and short texts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After taking a closer look, I found out that she had been doing some modeling activities locally in Hokkaido since her sophomore year of high school before she won the beauty pageant at the university.......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After getting into college, she moved to Kanagawa Prefecture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After becoming a college student and getting the top prize in the beauty pageant, she successfully signed up with a modeling agency to do print modeling mainly for fashion magazines.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On SNS, she proudly said that her modeling work was going smoothly and she was getting more and more work. However, it only lasted until this spring. After April 6, she stopped updating her account completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s when she became unobservable.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As far as he knew, the mini-skirt Santa Claus was only visible to Sakuta, but not to anyone else. This makes it impossible for her to be a model.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But she didn&#39;t say anything about &quot;Kirishima Touko&quot; on her SNS, nor did she say anything about music.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Does it mean that she is managing her modeling work and music work completely separately?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was impossible for Sakuta to know the reason for that since he was not her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll ask you about that when we meet again.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he came to that conclusion, Sakuta saw a familiar car parked in front of his apartment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A white van.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the car driven by Mai&#39;s manager, Ryoko Hanawa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As he got closer, he saw that the person in the driver&#39;s seat was indeed Hanawa Ryoko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ryoko greeted Sakuta after she spotted him. Sakuta responded in kind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Ryoko immediately averts her eyes and looks at the entrance to the apartment where he lives. Sakuta looks over as well - Mai is coming out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He walks up to Mai, who is about to open her umbrella, and tilts his own umbrella over to shield her from the rain.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;Sakuta, you&#39;re back. It&#39;s quite late today&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m back. I had to check something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;College homework?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Trouble.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did you make any progress?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can call it &quot;progress,&quot; but it&#39;s something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Since Sakuta hadn&#39;t come to a conclusion yet, he didn&#39;t know how to say it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll call you tonight, but I don&#39;t have time now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you going to work?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Work is tomorrow. But I have to go tonight to prepare. I have to attend a film festival in Fukuoka.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The kind where you have to walk down the red carpet in a dress?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes. The pretty kind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I want to see it too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ryoko-san will take a lot of pictures.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I want to see the real thing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to keep Mai, who was walking forward, from getting wet, Sakuta walked with her to the back side of the van. The automatic door slid open to welcome Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve already made dinner, so you and Kaede should finish eating first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai stepped into the car and immediately put on her seat belt. She also thanked Sakuta for giving her the umbrella.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way Sakuta&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve made a reservation at a hot spring inn in Hakone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;For Christmas Eve?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know if you can go, though.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m definitely going.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Even if you can&#39;t go, Ryoko-san will stay with me. So you don&#39;t have to force yourself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to stay at that hotel for a long time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ryoko-san, who had been listening silently, suddenly said something like a joke. No, maybe she really wanted to stay at that hotel. There was a tourist guide for Hakone on the passenger seat. She was more active than anyone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If I can&#39;t go, I&#39;ll ask Ryoko-san to have a good time for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I don&#39;t really want to go with Ms. Mai, if she is in a bad mood.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you two talking about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Ryoko-san laughed at the same time. Sakuta took a step away from the car door while laughing and gestured for Ryoko-san to drive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The sliding door began to slide forward and closed as if the last piece of the puzzle had been filled in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The car started slowly and finally disappeared into the night. The only red headlights that were still visible could not be seen after the turn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to the hot springs with Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said to himself as he took a bath in his bedroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;His body was getting warmer and warmer. His stomach was filled with the cabbage rolls with meat sauce made by Mai, and his heart was filled with anticipation for the little trip she had planned for Christmas Eve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But there was something that kept Sakuta from being 100% happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It would be nice if all this crap could be sorted out before Christmas Eve......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, that was almost impossible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Today is the 15th. There was only one week left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Will he be able to cure Kirishima Touko&#39;s puberty syndrome before then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it possible to cure Sara Himeji&#39;s puberty syndrome before then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At least for now, there is little hope for the former. Although today was superb, I haven&#39;t gotten any key information about Touko yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, it&#39;s extremely difficult to get the latter within a week. It was also unknown what Sara&#39;s attitude would be at the next cram session. It&#39;s not clear where things are going yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Besides, adolescent syndrome is a psychological problem of the patient himself. No matter how much care Sakuta tries to give, in the end it is up to the patient to overcome it. He cannot cure it himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This has been the case so far, and it will not change in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In the end, it was just a matter of letting nature take its course.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So Sakuta gave up thinking about the futility of thinking about it and finished the bath after his body had warmed up completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the dressing room, he rubbed his head with a towel, rubbing it from top to bottom - when the phone in the living room rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Brother, there is a strange phone call&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#39;t take long for Kaede to say that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then answer it for me first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he heard the strange number, Sakuta&rsquo;s first thought was that it was from Touko. If it was, then I couldn&#39;t let this opportunity slip away. I had to talk to her as much as possible. This was a good opportunity to get to know the person of Kirishima Touko. It would be a good opportunity to get to know the person of Kirishima Touko, and it would also be a clue to cure her adolescent syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, why do I have to get it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although Kaede grumbled discontentedly, she picked up the receiver.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta nimbly finished wiping his body and put on his underwear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Yes, that&#39;s right&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta, who ran to the living room in a pair of underwear, met eyes with Kaede who was answering the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Brother, it&#39;s from the cram school&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said, handing out the receiver.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;A tutor?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a man.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He picked up the receiver in disbelief.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello, someone else is answering the phone now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He answered the phone with a little trepidation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, Azusagawa-kun?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a familiar adult&#39;s voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Principal? What can I do for you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry to bother you so late at night. Himeji-san just called me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At Sara&#39;s name, he asked the same question again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing serious. She came to ask me for your contact information. She wanted to set up a schedule with you for the next tutoring session. After all, your family&#39;s contact information is private, so I came to ask for your permission.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, thank you for your generosity, Principal. It&#39;s perfectly fine with me, so please give her this number directly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay, I understand.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the other party hung up, Sakuta put the receiver back on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The phone was going to ring again soon anyway. Sara would call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess the principal was talking to Sara on the phone to tell her the contact information for his house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And now Sara will write down the number, say thank you, and hang up the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost time for Sara to call.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However - after five minutes, ten minutes - his phone still didn&#39;t ring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Did the principal not succeed in contacting Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re going to catch a cold if you keep this up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kaede, who had placed her computer on the low table of the heater and was listening to the online class, kindly reminded him. It&#39;s true, it&#39;s too much to wear just a pair of underwear in this season.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So he went back to his room to get dressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But at that moment, the phone rang.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Answer it, Kaede.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, again?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was some noise from the living room, and it was the sound of Kaede standing up. Knock, knock, knock - she took a big stride towards the phone, but the ringing stopped halfway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Brother, the phone was hung up&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta came to the living room after getting dressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta switched with Kaede in front of the phone. Kaede sat back down by the heater.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just as he was reaching to press the button to confirm who was calling, the phone rang again. It was the 11-digit cell phone number from 070.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta answered the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is Azusagawa&#39;s house.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, this is Himeji, a student of Sakuta&#39;s.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A nervous girl&#39;s voice was heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san? It&#39;s me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, great, it&#39;s Sakuta-sensei on the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s just a phone call, what&#39;s the big deal. And you even hung up once.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve never called anyone&#39;s home before, so I was nervous. ...... and I accidentally pressed &quot;hang up&quot;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta, who didn&#39;t even have a cell phone, couldn&#39;t understand the nervousness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, you&#39;d better get a cell phone&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A disgruntled voice came from across the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Calling the cram school to ask for your contact information is a lot of work in itself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I owe you an apology for that. I should have made it clear to you a long time ago. Ah, but you could have found out if you had asked Koga.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t wan&#39;t to bother her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; For Sara it probably made sense. But Sakuta doesn&#39;t understand what she&#39;s thinking. Wouldn&#39;t it be better to ask Koga again? Just tell her that she forgot to ask for his contact information when she got through. That&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a lot of brainstorming, anyway.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I could see Sara&#39;s pouting face through the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry, sorry. So, you wanted to talk about your schedule?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;That&#39;s just an excuse to ask for Sakuta-sensei&#39;s contact information.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;So you wanted to?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He cut to the chase. Sara on the other side of the phone took a deep breath and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I was out of line yesterday. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She apologized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think you were out of line, so you don&#39;t need to apologize. I&#39;m rather glad.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;because you insisted on choosing me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That... that is! You&#39;re forgetting about ......!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was so anxious that she shouted out at once, but her voice soon became smaller again ...... eventually becoming almost inaudible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But if it&#39;s just a small thing like that, we can talk about it the next time we meet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That way she won&#39;t have to bother with asking for Sakuta&#39;s contact information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t want to do that. I want to apologize sooner......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s okay. I really don&#39;t care.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not happy that you said that. Can&#39;t you care about me a little more?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I do think about Himeji-san. What I told you yesterday, I do want you to think about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Going to tutoring with Miss Futaba?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;From the sound of her voice, she didn&#39;t want to talk about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s not Rio. I just think it&#39;s for your own good to find a teacher who&#39;s worthy of your grades.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I have something to say about that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;If that&#39;s the case, why can&#39;t Sakuta-sensei think about improving his own skill?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, it was so formal.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s all I can do, I can&#39;t improve.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please do your best. I&#39;ll support you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s not a bad thing to have someone to cheer you up. It&#39;s true that you feel like you want to work hard. But Sakuta didn&#39;t say, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll try my best&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The choice Sara made might affect her future education. She should not say that lightly, she needs to take a longer time to think about it and discuss it before making a decision.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you have time after school tomorrow, Himeji-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I want to talk to you in person.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know. Ah, but tomorrow ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You have plans?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s like there&#39;s something going on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uh no, that ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her response was unusually vague. It was obviously deliberating, struggling with what to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If it&#39;s hard to say, then I won&#39;t force it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s okay. I&#39;m actually going to tell Sakuta-sensei about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that so? What do you think?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, Sekimoto-sensei wanted to talk to me face to face.......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The name was unfamiliar, so he couldn&#39;t remember who it was at first. But then Sakuta gradually remembered...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, is that the one from......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, the teacher who was in charge of my tutoring before Sakuta.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What was the point of wanting to meet in this situation. At least it wouldn&#39;t be a good feeling. The reason why Sakuta became a tutor for Sara was because a person named Sekimoto had a crush on Sara. Also he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s in Sekimoto&#39;s heart right now. In any case, that feeling is only Sekimoto&#39;s own desires. It was not the right time for Sara to meet with him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, where do you plan to meet tomorrow?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Since he heard about it, he couldn&#39;t just sit back and do nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;At Fujisawa Station at 5:00 p.m.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I see, then let&#39;s do it...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta began to give Sara his solution.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After hearing that, Sara exclaimed &quot;Huh&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The next day, Friday, December 16th.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta, who had been in class at the university until almost three o&#39;clock, left the classroom quickly after the bell rang and went straight to Fujisawa station. When he got off at Fujisawa station, the time was already past 4:30. From the electronic sign informing the departure time of the next train you can see the current time on the electronic sign that tells you the departure time of the next train.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He followed the person in front of him up the stairs and swiped his card at the ticket gate. When he came to the pedestrian overpass at the north entrance of the station, there was still a hint of blue sky in the east. The sky to the west had been completely tinted orange and was gradually getting closer to night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta sat down on a bench in front of the family store, and looked up at the sky as the night was slowly eroding. In less than ten minutes, the entire sky darkened. The streetlights in front of the station were all lit up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;People in the square lift their faces from their cell phone screens at this moment. There is also a light show in front of the station square during this period, so the station will look very glamorous and beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The time shown on the clock placed in the square is 4:45.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The time when the target appeared in the square was before the clock hit 4:46. A male wearing a dark gray coat with slim black pants. The short hair with hairspray looked crisp. Age is about 25 years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked around as if he was looking for someone. Even when he met eyes with Sakuta, he didn&#39;t pay much attention to him. It was understandable because he hadn&#39;t even met him a few times. Even when he passed him on the street, Sakuta would not have recognized him at once.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Since he couldn&#39;t find the person he was supposed to meet, the man sat down on the bench opposite Sakuta. He pulled out his cell phone from his coat for confirmation. And was doing something. Maybe he was sending a message to the other person, &quot;I&#39;ve arrived.&quot; or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the person he was waiting for was not coming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was the one who came instead of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He stood up and walked straight to the man. They stopped about ten meters apart. At that moment, the man who had been looking at his cell phone looked up in some confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s Sekimoto-sensei, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing this&ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh, oh, you&#39;re ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After seeing Sakuta&#39;s face, he also seemed to have noticed-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m Azusagawa, who works part-time at the cram school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, hmm&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although he made a sound as if he understood something, he still had a question in his sight. Because he didn&#39;t know why Sakuta was talking to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry. Himeji-san is not coming back today. I&#39;m here in her place&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Finally, he looked a little panicked as he connected the dots.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were a few glances coming from the eyes of the others in the square. Perhaps they had sensed the unusual atmosphere between Sakuta and Sekimoto.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to the extent of moving the bench to eat the melon. But it was obvious that someone was watching them and eavesdropping on them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &quot;I have nothing to talk to you about&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto stood up immediately. There was anxiety in his voice, some kind of exasperation-like feeling that was about to be pressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted to leave just like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please wait.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta subconsciously called out to him. Sekimoto also subconsciously stopped in his tracks. Sakuta could see from his ability to listen to others that he actually had a similar upbringing or congeniality. Socially speaking, it looked like he was a cram school teacher who had unpleasant thoughts about his own students. But he is actually a decent person. That&#39;s why he was taken by Sara. That&#39;s why he was taken by Sara who liked to &#39;play&#39; so much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta said to Sekimoto&#39;s back who was standing in the same place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please don&#39;t contact Himeji-san anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto slowly turned back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please don&#39;t meet with Himeji-san again.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto walked towards Sakuta indignantly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Sakuta could say the next word-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please, what!?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto clutched Sakuta&#39;s lapel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;All the pedestrians around looked over, but in the end they all left without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto was so agitated that he took two or three significant breaths and his chest rose and fell in an exaggerated manner.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After he calmed down a bit Sakuta continued -</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please ignore Himeji-san in the future, even if you receive contact from her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta stared straight into Sekimoto&#39;s eyes, conveying what he was really thinking inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Shaken. The eyes were wavering. He should also know exactly what that means.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s for Himeji-san&#39;s own good. So, if you&#39;re doing these things for her sake......please do this&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta bowed his head to Sekimoto.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto naturally let go of his hand, and his hand finally retracted completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you say to the cram school people about this......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice came from behind Sakuta, who was still maintaining his head down position.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta looked up and saw Sekimoto showing a somewhat troubled expression. It was a troubled look of wanting to hide something, but not being able to find a place to hide it. There was no way to get rid of this kind of distress - except Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll just report the results to the principal&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The results......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nothing happened. I think it&#39;s over now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Then, thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the most thankful thing Sekimoto could say at this moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I say something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Go ahead.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto seemed to have something to say, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, I don&#39;t want to say it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#39;t say it in the end. He probably wanted to ask something about Sara - has she mentioned me lately? How has she been doing lately? Is her tutoring going well ......&ndash;or maybe all of the above. But in the end, he didn&#39;t ask anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, can I say something too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sekimoto didn&#39;t say &#39;please speak&#39;, but he didn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t want to hear it either - nor could he say it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s not too late to wait for Himeji-san to graduate from high school, right? If you&#39;re still interested at that time, Mr. Sekimoto&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I&#39;ll think about it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He spat out those words like a sigh. He sounded like he was giving up. Only the words themselves seem to have an attitude. But on the other hand, this &quot;attitude in words&quot; is sometimes very important. At least for Sekimoto at this moment, it was important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll leave now. I&#39;m counting on you for Himeji-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You take care, too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He finally forced a smile and said this as if he was laughing and joking at the same time. He walked towards the station and soon disappeared in the crowd.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The eyes of the people behind Sakuta also disappeared after Sekimoto left. There was one last line of sight left....</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta turned back to look for the person who had been staring at him so far. He soon found it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a silhouette standing next to a flower bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was Sara who was looking at him worriedly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After meeting his eyes, she shivered violently and gave an expression like &quot;Oh no, I&#39;ve been found out&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He slowly walked towards Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you to wait for me at the cram school?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Your shirt buttons are missing&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked at Sakuta&#39;s lapel. It had fallen off when the lapel was grabbed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I still have the buttons ready.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The prepared button is sewn on the logo of the shirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve always wondered what kind of occasion this kind of reserve button would be used for. So this is the time to use them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta opened the hem of his shirt to show Sara the buttons. But her expression remained disappointed. Normally, she would have smiled and said, &quot;I&#39;ll sew it on for you, then! I&#39;ll sew it on for you! But even after waiting for a while, she still didn&#39;t say anything.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re done with the chores, so let&#39;s continue the conversation from yesterday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This response was also much more honest than the usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Sara sat face to face at the table. They ordered cream soda and snow top coffee respectively, and a pizza toast. It was a vintage coffee shop in an alleyway two or three minutes away from the station on foot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The chairs, tables, and menu all have a Showa feel to them. For some reason, even Sakuta, who had never experienced Showa, had a nostalgic feeling. The equation of &quot;Showa = nostalgia&quot; has been deeply rooted in people&#39;s hearts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The ice of the cream soda melted, and the ice cream part kept sinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re not going to take a picture?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta, who was watching her ice cream sink, spoke to Sara in front of her. Sara was the one who said she wanted to enter this store. She said she had always wanted to come here once, but the atmosphere of this cafe was too mature, and as a high school student, even with her friends, she could not go to the cafe. As a high school student, she didn&#39;t dare to go into this store even with her friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When she finally got her wish, she didn&#39;t even take a picture, but just sat there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I have a drink now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta held out his hand to Snowdome Coffee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, please wait, I want to take a picture!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara hurriedly took out her phone and took a picture of the cream soda, a picture of the snowdrop coffee, and then a picture of the toast. But she was much less excited than before when she took pictures of the donuts. It was like completing a task, not enjoying it at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her attention was clearly on something else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......That, Sakuta-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After she put the camera away...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I still think Sakuta-sensei is right for me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She stared straight at him. She was thinking about that just now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that so?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After his vague response, Sara&#39;s eyes quickly turned to the cream soda.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She picked up the glass and took a sip of ice cream, then raised her eyes after taking a sip of the soda.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that not okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This time it was his turn to move her eyes to the snow-topped coffee.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, don&#39;t you have a particular college you want to go to?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not yet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara stirred with the straw. The ice cream all sank into the soda.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That too. After all, you&#39;re only a freshman in high school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta also poked the ice cream on the coffee with the straw and stirred them together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why did you choose this current college, Sakuta-sensei?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;To have a sweet campus life with my girlfriend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta told the truth unapologetically. Sara burst out laughing. It was the first time she had smiled today. But it wasn&#39;t a very cheerful smile. There was a cloud in the smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You really like your girlfriend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I like her the most.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After being told that face to face, Sara couldn&#39;t help but turn her face away with a straight face. Her cheeks were a little red.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t say that to you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I know. I was shocked because it was so sudden. Besides, don&#39;t give the cram school students your impure motives for going on to higher education, okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara scolded Sakuta in a panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because I don&#39;t want to lie to my own students.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I see. Then I&#39;ll ask you another way.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I don&#39;t know what she knew.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why did Sakuta-sensei go to college?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s because......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can&#39;t answer &#39;to make out with your girlfriend&#39;, can you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara denied the answer Sakuta was about to give in advance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then I guess I&#39;ll have to think about the answer seriously. Even though it was a cram school, it was a lesson for a lifetime, so I had to take it seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t think about it that clearly when I took the university entrance exam, but I&#39;m studying at the university at this moment......to get my teaching qualification&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh? Is Sakuta-sensei really going to become a &quot;teacher&quot;?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her voice became shrill with surprise. It was rare to see her look so surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m fit to be a teacher. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m fit to be a teacher or not. I haven&#39;t told anyone about it yet, so you have to keep it a secret.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You haven&#39;t told your girlfriend yet?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And you haven&#39;t told Miss Futaba?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course not.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m not lying. It&#39;s not something I need to hide, but I just haven&#39;t found any opportunity to say it, but it doesn&#39;t seem necessary to announce it specifically. If the time was right, he would say it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So this is a secret between me and Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara smiled. She was getting back to her usual state.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But if you want to be a real teacher, then Sakuta-sensei should really improve his skills.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;To give accurate advice for the sake of the students&#39; future - I think that&#39;s what teachers should do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You don&#39;t want to tutor me that much?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said as she stirred the ice cream in her soda and lifted her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta reached out and grabbed the toast and took a bite.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then why......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I just want you to try to listen to other teachers&#39; classes too. It&#39;s for your own good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you find a better teacher than me you can just replace me, if not I&#39;ll take responsibility for improving my own. Don&#39;t you want that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Sakuta-sensei wouldn&#39;t you mind if I went for another teacher?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was still continuing to stir. The ice cream and soda had been mixed well. She stared straight at the product in the cup.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I would be happy as the teacher who took you originally, if this can make your grades go up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Even if you don&#39;t teach me yourself?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t care about that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Does that mean I don&#39;t matter to you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The most important thing for me is to be your helper as a tutor in a cram school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that what you really want?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta said so without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara stared at him with unblinking eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sakuta didn&#39;t care too much as he reached for his second piece of toast. Those words just now were his heartfelt words, so there was no need to cover anything up or say anything more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Even if it wasn&#39;t clear yet, she would one day understand what she was studying hard for and would have a clear goal. Sakuta did not want her to regret the choice she had made at that moment. It would be a shame not to go to the next level when you&#39;re so smart and so well equipped. If she worked hard now, she would have more options in the future. And those that are not related to Sakuta are nothing that can&#39;t be beaten. Sakuta will only try to help Sara achieve a more fulfilling life in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......I now understand that Sakuta is really thinking of me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After a while, Sara suddenly said these words. Then she drank up the rest of her cream soda.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, I&#39;ll try what Sakuta-sensei said.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She still had a defiant expression on her face. Although in her heart she understood that his words were right, she could not accept them emotionally. Her words and her expression showed her dissatisfaction with the fact that things were not going in the direction she had expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s enough.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta nodded and looked her way. But she was looking out the window, not meeting his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But if there is no suitable teacher, I will continue to trouble Sakuta-sensei in the future.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll ask you to help me upgrade.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll do anything.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said with a smile. But her smile was still not 100% clear. She still needed time to digest it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Only the side of her face that looked out the window gave the impression that she seemed to have made up her mind about something. She seemed to have started thinking about something more future. I&#39;m afraid it wasn&#39;t Sakuta&#39;s illusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After he finished the check and left the cafe. Sara bowed her head and thanked him for the treat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then he and Sara walk together to the station. In order to take Sara to the bus stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They kept silent and walked forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way Sakuta-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;While waiting for the traffic light, Sara suddenly spoke. She sounded inexplicably light-hearted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hmm?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta waited with some confusion for her to continue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s about time you figured out the answer to the assignment I gave you, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Homework?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The light turned green and they started to cross the sidewalk.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please don&#39;t play dumb. It&#39;s about my adolescent syndrome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, this. I don&#39;t get it at all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After all, Sakuta-sensei, you&#39;re not going to solve the problem I left for you at all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said with a smug look on her face, as if she knew everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The meaningful words made him have a deeper question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re going to solve my adolescent syndrome directly by extrapolating from the phenomenon, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s words made his heart jump wildly. But the surprise was short-lived. All that remained was a deep question and a chill similar to fear. No matter how smart Sara&#39;s brain was, she couldn&#39;t have calculated this far.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before arriving at the bus stop - Sakuta stopped shortly after entering the traffic circle. It was just below the pedestrian bridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s better for Sakuta-sensei not to cure my adolescent syndrome, and for your own sake, Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara also stopped a few steps ahead of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The orange street light illuminated the two of them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara smiled and looked back at him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve looked it up. It&#39;s called &#39;clairvoyance&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had her phone in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Clairvoyance?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;No matter how far away the other person is from me, I can see what the other person is doing right now and understand what the other person is thinking.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, I know a lot of secrets about Sakuta.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;I think my secrets are the teacher&#39;s license and the PIN number of my bank card that I told you about today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And the fact that you&#39;re looking for Shouko Kirishima.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You were surprised, weren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;To be honest, yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, I know what the PIN number of my bank card is. It&#39;s your girlfriend&#39;s birthday, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;You know what color underwear I&#39;m wearing today?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is sexual harassment, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She really seemed angry?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t peek when you take a shower or something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thought it was okay to be peeked at, but if he said it out loud, he would be accused of sexual harassment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re a sexual harasser too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara reprimanded with a shy expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, a person&#39;s freedom of thought was being strictly suppressed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Back to the topic......Himeji-san, can you see what Kirishima Touko is doing right now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I can&#39;t know that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The answer was different from what Sakuta was expecting. It was clear that she had just said she could. What&#39;s going on here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not everyone can. My ability is limited to people I&#39;ve met......and, like this, have bumped into each other rather violently.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She used her other hand to pat the one holding the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, quantum entanglement, huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara asked, puzzled. Judging from this reaction, although she could tell what Sakuta was thinking, she had no way of peering into his&#12302;memory&#12303;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After this layer of Sakuta&#39;s thinking was read by her, she returned an affirmative look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Quantum entanglement is an amazing phenomenon that occurs in the microscopic world. I don&#39;t understand the principle in more detail&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this moment, the exact principle is simply irrelevant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There were more important things to consider.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That is how to exploit Sara&#39;s adolescent syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With a little exploitation, he would be able to know what Kirishima Touko was thinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It would be a pie in the sky for Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think I can help Sakuta-sensei with this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;By the way, can you see Kirishima Touko?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not without confirming that premise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I can see. Santa Claus in a miniskirt&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The biggest premise, the most fundamental problem, was solved so easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, Sakuta-sensei, let me go see Kirishima Touko.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The problem is, she&#39;s not someone you can just see when you want to.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t even describe her as a ghost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But you have an appointment with her to broadcast her new song, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s true. That means Sara saw the conversation between him and Kirishima Touko at that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you think that&#39;s an appointment.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem was that date.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Touko said she wanted him to come and help her on December 24th.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It happened to be Christmas Eve.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That makes sense. Why I am with Sakuta on Christmas Eve&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was very happy, as if she had solved a puzzle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Sakuta was still stern-faced.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Couldn&#39;t we avoid such a fate. Although he had thought about it with all his might, he couldn&#39;t see any hope. In the end, the only way to deal with Kirishima Touko is to sacrifice the little trip with Mai. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, Akagi brought that kind of significant information from another world line ......he had to figure out what that meant as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, are you free on the 24th?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;For the sake of Sakuta-sensei&#39;s pleading, it&#39;s not like I can&#39;t have a date with Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s going to be cold, so come in more clothes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta finally had to say these words to save face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Now things have become magical&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta sighed as he soaked in the bathtub.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at his wet face reflected in the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was really amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although it was amazing, a few things became clear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;First, the dream that he had about Christmas Eve. Now it&#39;s clear why he was with Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The other was the true nature of Sara&#39;s adolescent syndrome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He hadn&#39;t thought anything strange was happening around her, but after she volunteered the symptoms, Sakuta believed her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Clairvoyance&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;No matter how far away the other person was, she could know what the other person was doing and thinking no matter where they were. That means it is a phenomenon that Sara had alone. It was difficult for Sakuta to actively detect this abnormality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But what exactly is it like to have clairvoyance?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;According to Sara, she should be able to see him in the shower right now. But she also said that she would never peek at him in the shower. So she should not be watching now. That means that no matter what he does now, no matter what he thinks, Sara should not be watching him right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If it is quantum entanglement in nature ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A thought popped into his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A long time ago, Rio had explained quantum entanglement to Sakuta. Two particles that hit each other with sufficient force would somehow synchronize. The synchronized particles could synchronize their states with each other no matter how far away they were.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Of course, this is what happens in the tiny world that is invisible to the naked eye.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And Rio also said that the microscopic world is completely different from the macroscopic world and cannot be copied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, if it is forcibly copied, it means that Sakuta&#39;s state can be instantly synchronized with Sara&#39;s, no matter how far away she is. So Sara can see what Sakuta sees and think what Sakuta thinks. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What about the other way around?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Can Sara&#39;s state be synchronized to Sakuta&#39;s as well?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;s already in sync?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe he just didn&#39;t realize it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe no one who was entangled with Sara realized it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Or maybe they didn&#39;t believe it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The only way to become a &#39;fact&#39; is to be recognized.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then let&#39;s try......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Close your eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I can&#39;t see anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I can only hear the sound of the ventilation fan in the bathroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;You can&#39;t see anything else, you can&#39;t hear anything else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s for sure. It can&#39;t be that good. Sakuta&#39;s hypothesis can&#39;t be verified. And it was still one that Rio had long ago disproved......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just as such negative thoughts were bubbling out of his head one after another - he felt music in his ears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t an illusion. It was definitely heard. It was as if he was listening to music with headphones. Rather, after feeling &quot;like listening to headphones&quot;, he began to feel that there was no other possibility than &quot;listening to headphones&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a song that Sakuta had also heard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a song by Kirishima Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;When he opened his eyes, he realized that he was not in the bathtub.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was lying on a bed in an unfamiliar room. He was using the pillow as a cushion to lie on top of and play with his phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was reading a guide for his winter trip.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;His heart was full of anticipation and happiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The thinking is also clear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;This is so cute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Wouldn&#39;t Sakuta-sensei like this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Hey, I can&#39;t figure out what to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;isn&#39;t there anything better?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She ran her finger across the screen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Have to decide where to go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;And anyway, we&#39;ll end up going to Sakuta-sensei&#39;s university ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;Then let&#39;s go to Kamakura on the way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; Then......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, a voice from outside the room interrupted the thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sara, are you taking a bath? If not, dad will do it first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, wait, I want to take a bath!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I stopped the music and took off the headphones.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When I got up from the bed, I saw a very girly room. The pattern of the curtains, the neatly arranged things on the desk, the small cactus potted plant......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The hand that opened the closet took out new pajamas and underwear, and the floor mirror next to it reflected Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was as if Sakuta himself was looking in the mirror.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta&#39;s eyes snapped open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In front of his eyes was the familiarity of his own bathroom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;His wet face was still reflected in the water.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So this is what it feels like......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;By &#39;being able to see&#39;, Sara didn&#39;t mean observing others from other perspectives, but being able to see what that person sees and feel what that person feels and thinks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;It&#39;s really quite a wonderful feeling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He wanted to try something else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sara just said she wanted to take a bath, so it&#39;s not really appropriate to try it right away. And it&#39;s best to keep this a secret from her. He was afraid she has a lot of scenes that she doesn&#39;t want to be seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He naturally recalled Sara&#39;s state just now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had looked so happy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was looking forward to her date with him on the 24th.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was so excited, and Sakuta couldn&#39;t have asked for more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But when the time came, there was a feeling of guilt in his heart, and he couldn&#39;t feel happy. Including his thoughts on Sara&#39;s adolescent syndrome, he felt all kinds of sorry for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What to do about this......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But, he couldn&#39;t just let it go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#39;t want to just let it go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Brother, Mai-san is calling.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The voice of Kaede came from outside the bathroom door.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You tell her I&#39;ll call back soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With that, Sakuta went out of the bathroom. This time, he had soaked longer than usual, so he felt a little dizzy. But now it was time to use all his brain to think of a good way to explain to Mai what happened on January 24th.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m going to have to think of a good way to explain to Mai about February 24th.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It would be nice if she would allow the Christmas Eve date to be postponed.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta, who had left the bathroom, prayed and dialed Mai&#39;s number.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c4" id="h.xpkke91imfd0"><span class="c5">Chapter 4: 12.24</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; December 24th.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the morning of Christmas Eve, Sakuta was woken up by Nasuno stomping on his face. The time was already past eight in the morning, a little later than usual.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If he had been scheduled for the earliest class today, he would have been late. But he had finished all his classes for this year the day before, and there were no more classes for the year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;So he could sleep in the warmth of his blanket. No one would blame him even if he was back to sleep. He didn&#39;t have to go to his part-time job today either. However, Sakuta got up anyway. Because of a very important appointment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......it&#39;s exactly the same as the morning of December 24th in his dream.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After seeing the clock that read 8:11, Sakuta went out of his room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just like in the dream, he fed Nasuno with cat food first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Toasted bread in the toaster while frying eggs and sausages on the stove. After finishing up, he and Nasuno finished breakfast together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After collecting the dishes and washing the clothes, he returned to the living room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, a sleepy-looking Kaede came out of the room. It was exactly the same as in the dream.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Good morning, brother......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you want to eat breakfast?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Eat&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kaede yawned as she came to the table.

But she still tore open the toast and soaked it into the cocoa and then ate it. Her expression then changed to one of joy at having eaten something delicious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re going to have lunch with Kano, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did I tell you about my plans for lunch?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s what I saw in my dream. But in fact, in his dream, Kaede only said that she was going to see the Sweet Bullet concert with Kano Kimi, and then she would not go back to Fujisawa in the evening, but go directly to his parents&#39; home in Yokohama City, and spend Christmas there. He didn&#39;t hear her say the lunch arrangements herself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re not leaving until after ten, are you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, where will my brother be?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be out after noon.&quot;, he said, and the sound of the washing machine finishing its laundry sounded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Remember to tell your mom and dad that I&#39;m going to visit them on New Year&#39;s when you go back home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta said to Kaede as she walked to the laundry room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Kaede responded to him while eating her toast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After drying the clothes, cleaning the room, and sending Kaede away, Sakuta started to pick up after himself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As he had told her, it was after noon when he left the house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Nasuno, please watch the house&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nasuno, who was pawing at her face, sent him out with a meow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">His goal was Fujisawa station, which was about a ten minutes&#39; walk from the apartment.

She wore a down jacket over her sweater, and the lower half of her body wore slitted pants of a similar texture to jeans.

The conversation didn&#39;t go on. No, she wouldn&#39;t let the conversation go on. For her, &quot;moving together&quot; was already a given. She wasn&#39;t requesting Sakuta&#39;s permission or discussing with him. She was simply reporting to Sakuta. It was impossible to continue the conversation, because the topic was already over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai-san, when I called you earlier to explain the situation, I remember you said, &#39;I understand,&#39; right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m so prepared.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai, who had her hands in the pockets of her down jacket, posed proudly like a model.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, my Mai is also the cutest today.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please say it with your heart.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai reached out and grabbed Sakuta&#39;s cheek.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s true, it&#39;s really cute.

If you follow this road all the way, you will be able to drive on the coastal road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike the car that was moving briskly, the atmosphere inside the car was unusually heavy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Only the sound of the car moving sounded light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first person to speak was Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to her, Mai was still staring straight ahead at the road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She looks like she&#39;s a bit overwhelmed, so introduce me quickly.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She glanced at the rearview mirror. In the rearview mirror, Sara, who didn&#39;t dare to do anything rashly, was reflected. Her back hadn&#39;t touched the back of the car since she got in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, Mai&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why are you overwhelmed? It&#39;s not like I caught you in the act.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;In terms of mood, I feel something like that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then you better give a good introduction.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Indeed, that was the only way to break the awkward atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta looked at Sara, who was sitting in the back seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She seemed a little nervous. No, there was no doubt that she was nervous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sure you know her. This is my girlfriend, Sakurajima Mai.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I know her. I watched the morning drama last year and the latest movie! In the movie, I got goosebumps from the concert singing scene.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; She was talking as if she was giving an afterthought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thanks a lot.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai smiled calmly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And, she&#39;s Sara Himeji, the student I&#39;m tutoring at the cram school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; This time it was to introduce Sara to Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She goes to Minegahara High School, so she&#39;s considered our schoolmate&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The car stopped at the red light.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai looked back at Sara&#39;s eyes and greeted her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello, how are you? I&#39;m glad to meet you for the first time!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara blinked her eyes quickly, as if to say that this is the real person, that this is the &quot;Mai Sakurajima&quot;...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakurajima Mai was moving and talking in front of herself - this state of mind that she felt surprised and felt inauthentic was clearly conveyed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can I call you Sara-san?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, yes, of course it&#39;s fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can also call me Mai. My last name is too awkward to pronounce.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san, be careful. I&#39;ve been called &quot;Mai&quot; by her before and she got angry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I wasn&#39;t angry, okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;but you were really angry.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, I wasn&#39;t. I was just teaching a lesson to a rude and impolite student.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Look, that&#39;s how it is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara didn&#39;t respond. She opened her mouth halfway and forced out a smile. I&#39;ve never seen such a silly smile before. Maybe she didn&#39;t dare to agree with what Sakuta said in front of Mai&#39;s eyes. Or maybe it was because of she was shocked by the nonchalant conversation between Mai and Sakuta. I think the latter is more likely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;While Sara was still trying to process the information.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is Sakuta doing a good job at the cram school?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai waved the subject off without a care in the world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think I&#39;m quite popular with the students.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I didn&#39;t ask you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai ignored Sakuta, who made a disgruntled grunt. Then she asked Sara through the rearview mirror, &quot;How is he?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, I think he&#39;s really popular with the students.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said that in a skeptical tone. But if he interrupts now, she&#39;ll say something like, &quot;Shut up, Sakuta,&quot; and it&#39;s not a good idea to show that side of her to the students, so it&#39;s better to shut up and listen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s true. He also tutors Yamada-san and Yoshikazu-san, and they often talk to Sakuta-sensei.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;About studying?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai would no doubt ask about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Well, mainly about love.....Yamada-san even asked him for advice on how to get a girlfriend.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara laughed in the middle of the sentence. Now she wasn&#39;t so nervous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta, what kind of nonsense are you teaching in the cram school?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m trying to teach math.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But I don&#39;t know why the students keep coming over and asking questions that have nothing to do with studying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I think I blame Mai for that, don&#39;t I?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If you know that he is dating Mai Sakurajima, anyone would be interested in this topic. Math is worthless in front of this. It can&#39;t be helped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t throw it around&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The red light appeared again in front of me. After stopping the car, Mai reached out and grabbed Sakuta&#39;s cheek.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It hurts! Eh! Look! The light is green, Ms. Mai!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta pointed to the green light in front of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai let go of her hand and stepped on the gas along with the car in front of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is this how you two feel all the time?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What feeling?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai asked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What kind of feeling?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta asked the same question a second too late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s this feeling of being in tune with each other.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said with a complicated expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Usually it&#39;s much sweeter than now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t get mad in front of the students.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though she retorted to Sakuta, Mai smiled. She didn&#39;t specifically try to deny the fact that they were sweet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sara&#39;s expression got even more complicated as she didn&#39;t know what to say. Because these two had no room for her to intervene.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the contrary, the car journey was smooth. The car drove past the station of Shonan Light Rail that could be seen on the left hand side. It was Shonan Enoshima Station. On the right hand side is the train signal in front of Enoden Enoshima station. Just in time for the train headed towards Fujisawa to pass by.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, it was a moving train, so the scenery disappeared quickly in the back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The car continued to drive down the road and finally came to a junction. This was not just a junction of a crosswalk and a motorway, but also a place where Enoden&#39;s line would drive through. It was lined with stores and private houses. This is the only stretch of road where Enoden would drive on the road before arriving at the Waikoshi station. This section of road is also the legacy of the former road trains. This road with priority for tram traffic has survived until now under the care of the residents, thus creating this unique view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The car passes through this street with the warmth of the people in no time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In front of the station, you will say goodbye to the railway line that runs inside of the station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After this, the train will take the train line and the car will continue to take the motorway.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In front of you is a straight road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On both sides, there are signs that say &quot;Ginko&quot; and &quot;Raw Ginko&quot;. After driving through this road, the car comes to the coastal road.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is National Highway 134 which runs along the coastline.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai cut to Kamakura, the direction of Amako.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the driver&#39;s side, you can see the winter ocean reflecting the dazzling sunlight, and Enoshima Island can be seen at the diagonal rear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he watched, the short train with green and cream colors passed by this side of Sakuta. Enoden started to speed up after passing through the narrow section with residential houses on both sides, and was able to run parallel to cars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On the left was Enoden and on the right was the sea. Only in a car could he enjoy being sandwiched between the two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although it was a view that he had seen before, it was incredibly fresh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The car arrived at Kamakura High School Station together alongside the Enoden.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike the trains that needed to stop at the station, the car was still moving forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After walking for a while, a red light appeared in front of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the red light at the intersection of Minegahara High School.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Mai&#39;s eyes naturally turned to the school building of their alma mater, which was built along the coast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The view from inside the car was more refreshing than nostalgic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a place that he was tired of coming to, but now it looked strange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah, this tea is for Sara-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai pointed to the plastic bottle of tea stuck in the refreshment stand as if she suddenly remembered. There are two bottles. Sakuta pulled out one of the bottles.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a hint of warmth left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Here, it&#39;s yours.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta reached out and handed it over. Sara thanked him and took it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What about Ms. Mai?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was only one bottle of tea left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll just have a sip of Sakuta&#39;s.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta opened the cap of the remaining bottle and handed it to Mai. Mai took a sip while looking at the traffic light, thanked her and gave the bottle back to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He put the cap back on and put it back in place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;During this time, he could feel the vision Sara sitting in the back seat. It had been like that since she got in the car. She was looking for an opportunity to say something to him. But she was troubled by the fact that she couldn&#39;t find any such opportunity at all. Her usual strengths of being lovable and talkative were completely unavailable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the green light, the car continued to drive along the sea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he looked at the school, he could see several people walking towards the school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are we still having club activities at Christmas?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Speaking of club activities, I remembered ...... Sakuta, have you seen Yoshikazu-san this week?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara, who had finally found something to talk about, leaned over to the front seat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I saw her yesterday, because I had arranged to move her class to yesterday. I think she lost in the semi-finals of the beach volleyball tournament.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, she won the third place match and got the third best result in the country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She got a tan.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s said that the temperature there is very high, so there are many teams that compete in swimsuits.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before Sakuta asked, Juri told Sakuta such information as if she was looking for an excuse. Her face, which had been tanned hard, was red for reasons other than &#39;the sun&#39;......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai, who sensed that there was something in their conversation, asked with some confusion.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That Yoshikazu has a boy he likes. But that boy likes me......so Sakuta-sensei gave her a great suggestion in order to make that boy turn to her&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s tone seemed very smug. She was enjoying the thrill of exposing Sakuta&#39;s secret in front of Mai, in anticipation of the fishy things that would happen next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta must have said something like showing her swimsuit tan to the boys anyway, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai said the correct answer as if nothing had happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Great, you got it right......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara didn&#39;t expect her to hit the nail on the head. She didn&#39;t think it was possible to guess the answer so easily, it was impossible for a normal person to give such an answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No wonder you&#39;re Mai. You know me so well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s what you would say. But don&#39;t say that to anyone in the future.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......you two are a real couple.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara leaned her back against the back seat as if she had given up her resistance, and sighed unconsciously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What? You thought it was fake originally?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai, who was holding the steering wheel, laughed out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uh no, I mean the two of you are really close. Sakuta is also showing a side that he would never show in cram school&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Did you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s that look of being a nymphomaniac all the time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s somewhat unhappy expression was reflected in the rearview mirror of the car door. It was a more childish expression than usual, maybe it was an expression similar to her age.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After meeting Sara&#39;s eyes in the mirror, she immediately ducked her eyes away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because Sakuta loves me&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai said that happily, making Sakuta wonder if she noticed that Sara was a little upset. No, she definitely did. It was because he knew that she was smiling, because she knew that she was deliberately using such an irritating statement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What was the right thing for him to do at this moment?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He wished someone could tell him the correct answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What could make him safe to date his own student accompanied by his girlfriend......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After the car drove along the Yubihama coast for some time, it turned left at an intersection before the Slide River.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the sign, Kamakura was ahead in this direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;This Way&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After parking the car in the parking lot near Kamakura Station, Mai returned on foot the same way without hesitation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Where are you going, Mai?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know, at least not yet. And there was no way to guess. The only thing I do know is that they are heading somewhere different from the regular tour route. They were moving farther and farther away from Komachi shopping street, which was full of interesting shops and tourists, and Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine, the landmark of Kamakura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s not usually crowded here, is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara, who was walking beside Sakuta, said as she looked around at the unfamiliar scenery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Here we are.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After walking for three minutes or so, Mai stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Next to her was a small, simple and elegant store with a cozy decor. It was undoubtedly a new store in Kamakura, which had a long history.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai-san, what is this place?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The signboard reads &#39;Mont Blanc&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;d like to bring a gift for Ms. Kirishima Touko. If you want Sara-san to read her mind, she needs to hit her hard, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right, while Mont Blanc is attracting her attention.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How hard do you have to hit her?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai asked to Sara, who was hiding behind Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uh......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara clapped her hands a little harder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s enough&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the strength of a serious applause.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Where should we collide?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Anywhere is fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then it&#39;s not that difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think the hardest part is getting a Mont Blanc.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was a long line outside the store. If you think about it, today is December 24, Christmas Eve, a day when couples flood the world. I&#39;m sure there are many couples coming to Kamakura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There were about 15 groups of people in line. Even if each group only waited for a minute, it would take 15 minutes. Look at the situation in the store, a minute is not enough to get a group of people. Because it&#39;s the kind of mombu that takes orders and then squeezes the cream, I&#39;m sure it will take me more than 30 minutes to get my turn, including payment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then Sakuta, you wait in line first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What about you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll go get the pigeon cake and walnut cake that Nodoka asked me to buy first. Sara-san, why don&#39;t you come with me too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh!?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta and Sara both exclaimed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Let&#39;s go&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before they could react, Mai was on the move again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll go first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara, who had lost the chance to express her opinion, ran to follow Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is it really okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta, who was at the end of the line, was worried.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course he was worried about Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no way Mai would do anything wrong. Although he believed that Mai wouldn&#39;t mess up, this situation itself could be considered messy. At least it was certainly unusual. Sara was caught up in such a low-probability event.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Sakuta hadn&#39;t expected Mai to show up. Nor did he dream of her in his dreams.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This event was unusual and deviated dramatically from the reality dreamed by &#12302;#dreaming&#12303;. There is no point in predicting dreams at this moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But clairvoyance can still be useful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid that Sara won&#39;t find out if I use it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, she is now with Mai and has no time to think about him......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta let his consciousness fly while looking at the menu. Searching for the entwined consciousnesses in the darkness, he found and reached out his hand to it ......Finally, he held it tightly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, he saw something he should not have seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the back of Mai who wasn&#39;t here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the back of Mai who was looking from Sara&#39;s point of view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was walking on the path with Mai, following her at the same speed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the most important road in Kamakura......Wakamiya Avenue, where you can reach Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine if you keep walking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The second Torii, which could be seen a few dozen meters away, was extraordinarily bright red under the winter sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But Sara didn&#39;t care about that side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She kept staring at Mai&#39;s back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--What the hell am I doing......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I could hear Sara&#39;s thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I was supposed to be walking around Kamakura with Sakuta-sensei at this time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;---Renting kimonos to wear in the Komachi shopping street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I definitely want him to say &#39;cute&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Let him take a picture of me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--And take a group photo.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Eat dumplings together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Go see Sakurabe&#39;s accessories together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Let Sakuta-sensei choose for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Let him buy me a present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--and then have tea at the temple with a lot of bamboo ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;---I obviously did a lot of homework, and now it&#39;s all gone to waste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Now he won&#39;t look at me at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--just because this person is there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Thinking is running.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s eyes, which were filled with discontent, kept sticking to Mai&#39;s back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai didn&#39;t feel it. No, if it was Mai she would have been able to pretend not to notice even if she did. The theatrical power of a national actress is no joke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta couldn&#39;t even tell which side of Mai Sara saw right now. But he was willing to make a blind guess that Mai had noticed. She had appeared in front of him on the basis of calculating everything that might happen today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--But I envy her so much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--She was tall and tall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Her hair was dark and shiny.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Small face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Her skin is so nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Long legs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Good figure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--And sassy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Why would such a perfect person go out with Sakuta-sensei?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was always thinking about Mai, and Sakuta was forced to get involved in her thoughts. But he wasn&#39;t irritated by such questions. He was used to it. Even now, at university, he still could feel people staring at him with such questioning eyes.

What&#39;s wrong with a little vanity. Because.......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can&#39;t you do it......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s okay, right?

That was the point. Although she couldn&#39;t tell what was wrong, she felt something wrong in her heart, so she used the question &quot;No?&quot; That&#39;s why she used a rhetorical question like that. This reveals that Sara was uncomfortable with the answer in her heart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s not that......!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; She was desperately trying to deny her own thinking. She was trying to get herself together through denial. It was also like she was desperately protecting something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The self she is desperately trying to protect is the self she has constructed so far. Her values. She wanted to admit that they were wrong.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;That&#39;s why Sara wouldn&#39;t agree with what Mai said, couldn&#39;t agree, didn&#39;t want to agree. At the same time, she hadn&#39;t asked Mai for an answer, so she couldn&#39;t back down from that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...... is not that&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara finally spoke up again. She was speaking with a rebellious mood. But this was actually completely expected by Mai. She was being controlled by Mai. Her mood was completely being played with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta wish Mai had shown mercy. The opponent was a high school student, and still only a senior. However, his thoughts did not reach Mai&#39;s mind. He didn&#39;t have the means.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why did Sara-san want to choose Sakuta as her teacher?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s because......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara didn&#39;t know how to answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because I heard that she was the lover of Mai Sakurajima, so I wanted to tease him?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, her mind went blank. All her thinking was scared to death at this moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How about it? Can you successfully seduce him?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was speechless, and she just looked at Mai&#39;s face, unblinking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--such a pretty face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the first thing she felt in this situation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I can&#39;t win if his girlfriend is so perfect.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the second thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re asking me that on purpose, knowing that it&#39;s impossible, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;-- but why......?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s right&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai readily admitted it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Why would I ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;All the people I&#39;ve been eyeing so far have fallen in love with me. Even the ones who have girlfriends.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;-- Why would I be serious about something like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But that guy&#39;s girlfriend isn&#39;t me, is she?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai&#39;s attitude didn&#39;t waver.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That guy isn&#39;t Sakuta either, is he?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rather, the more she said, the more unshakable she seemed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......But you don&#39;t know unless you try, do you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--That&#39;s enough. I don&#39;t want to... enough, I don&#39;t want to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Maybe that&#39;s true. After all, it was Sakuta who made the final choice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I&#39;m wrong, can&#39;t I? Stop ...... If I keep this up ...... I&#39;m going to become something I&#39;m not......!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara let out a miserable scream inside, tearing her heart out. It felt like if Mai said even one more word, she was going to completely collapse.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But reality didn&#39;t develop that way --</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;ve gone off topic&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this moment, Mai gave in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You want to ask me why I chose Sakuta, don&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara responded in a small, almost inaudible voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;No matter what ridiculous requests I make, Sakuta will meet them, and he will try his very hardest to meet them. Because of my involvement in show business, I sometimes suddenly change my schedule, and sometimes I can&#39;t walk with him in public openly. His attitude makes me feel much more relaxed. It makes me feel comfortable.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai looked like she was talking about something trivial.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is that the reason?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara couldn&#39;t accept it yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s true. But Mai could go on and on, there was so much more to say. ...... What she had just said was just the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s also the fact that he&#39;s been saying that my cooking is good. That&#39;s why I feel happy when we cook together, and the time we spend eating together makes me feel good&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sara&#39;s heart was full of questions. She didn&#39;t understand what exactly she was listening to Mai say right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Also, he&#39;s always been able to say the words &#39;love&#39; in the most casual way. Although sometimes it&#39;s a bit annoying when he says it too much, that&#39;s all.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai couldn&#39;t help but laugh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t get it at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s when she felt Sara&#39;s puzzled look.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There were many other reasons. So many that I can&#39;t even count them. He can say &#39;thank you&#39; and &#39;sorry&#39; graciously, he has trustworthy friends, and he always thinks of his friends. He loves his sister, Kaede. He loves his cat Nasuno, and he cares about the students in his cram school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you mean me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you can read his mind, you can understand, right? He&#39;s been thinking about you all day today. More than he&#39;s been thinking about me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Yes, he&#39;s been worried about me. He&#39;s been thinking about me......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;He&#39;s the kind of person who lives for others - and insists he&#39;s doing it for himself. I don&#39;t hate his twisted personality, although I sometimes find it a bit annoying.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai smiled heartily. There was warmth in her eyes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--But, I don&#39;t want him to worry about me, what I want is--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can you take this as an answer?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara didn&#39;t say &#39;yes&#39;. There was still confusion and bewilderment in her expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;These kinds of feelings cannot be fully explained in words. But I can answer why Sakuta and I are dating in a very simple and concise way.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara lifted her head. She desperately wanted to know the answer to that question.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......why?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai&#39;s expression softened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t an attempt to muddle through, not a hesitation. As she had just said, she could make it clear in one sentence. Because the answer was in her heart, and Sakuta had the same answer in mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s because we are happy together&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai smiled with deep emotion, as if she was chewing on that feeling over and over again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I chose him because he was the only one who could make me feel that way.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She added this sentence in passing. This gave a clear shape to the vague feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara was speechless. It was different from any words, any feelings she had imagined. There was a warmth in Mai&#39;s brief words that she hadn&#39;t even expected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--This is, what......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The whole body was surrounded by warmth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--This is something I&#39;ve never seen before--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Engulfed in warmth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--this kind of thing......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Engulfed in warmth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;---I&#39;ve never even heard of--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yeah, but honestly we&#39;re happy enough at this point.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai smiled softly. It was the kind of smile that made people feel her happiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara still couldn&#39;t say anything. The feelings in her heart couldn&#39;t take shape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--No......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, her heart gradually became excited--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I really don&#39;t understand ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you don&#39;t believe me, why don&#39;t you confirm it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can peer into my heart.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai held out her hand as if to shake her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So that you can understand everything, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara subconsciously extended her hand. But she stopped in mid-extension.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--What to do......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s fingertips were trembling. She was obviously hesitating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--What should I do......?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;No one could answer that question for her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The answer was only for her to figure out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Answers given by others are only answers given by others after all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai held out her hand towards Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Wait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The distance between their fingertips was only five centimeters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Wait a minute.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Three centimeters.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash;I said wait.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;2 cm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I said......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s going to happen soon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t want it......!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara retracted her hand to her chest as she shouted out. Then the other hand clutched her own hand, as if she was protecting something very important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--I don&#39;t want to know!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara&#39;s strong feelings of rejection echoed in Sakuta&#39;s head. The sharp edge of emotion pierced into the chest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;-- How can I win ...... against such a person how can I win......!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, as if the phone had been unilaterally hung up, Sakuta suddenly couldn&#39;t see anything, couldn&#39;t hear anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Tried again and it still didn&#39;t work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The connection with Sara was cut off. There was no way to know where she was doing or what was going through her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The next customer ......sorry to keep you waiting!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The clerk with Mont Blanc&#39;s menu looked at Sakuta. Seeing the clerk&#39;s smile, he came back to his senses...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At the deep end of the long counter, his made-to-order Mont Blanc was being carefully wrapped up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just he finished paying, he waited anxiously for the moment when the packing was finished--</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &quot;That, excuse me ...... Excuse me, is this Mr. Azusagawa?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Another clerk at the checkout counter spoke to him, and had a phone in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s me ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Being called by name by a stranger still surprises him a lot. What the hell is going on?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Your companion called the store......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The clerk who was explaining the reason to him also seemed overwhelmed. Since this was the first time this had happened, it was clear that the clerk didn&#39;t know how to respond.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, I forgot my cell phone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If he said he didn&#39;t have a cell phone, things would only get more wordy, so Sakuta lied without hesitation and took the clerk&#39;s phone. It was a landline type phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hey, hey, hey, hey, it&#39;s Azusagawa speaking.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The receiver spoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A familiar voice came to his ear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Mai?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry, Sara-san is missing.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She disappeared just as I was checking out my souvenirs. I tried to look around, but I couldn&#39;t find her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai spoke faster than usual because of the suddenness of the incident.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Where are you now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m in front of the pigeon cake store.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;To get there from here, you need to walk along Wakamiya Avenue towards Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine. The main store is on the way to Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine. If you hurry, it will take about 10 minutes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then wait for me there. I&#39;ll be right there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get there soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After that, Sakuta hung up the phone. Then he asked the clerk to borrow the phone and called another cell phone number she had just memorized. It was Sara&#39;s cell phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The first call went unanswered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The second call went unanswered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After the third call, the phone was answered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;No one spoke on the other side, but I could feel the scent of a person. I can also hear the noisy ambient sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san? It&#39;s me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But the phone was hung up in the middle of the sentence. The moment before it was hung up, he heard a sound like taking a breath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He tried to dial again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, this time, no matter how long he waited, no one answered. In the end, he could only hear a mechanical response like &quot;The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#39;t matter how many times I called.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thanked the clerk and gave the phone back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sorry. I&#39;ll pick it up later, can I leave it at your store?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh. Of course, but please don&#39;t delay too long......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He knew how worried the clerk was. Because Mont Blanc has a short life span. While waiting in line, Sakuta noticed that this store was a sister store to the Mont Blanc store that he and Touko had visited together before. So this store&#39;s &nbsp;shelf life of the Mont Blanc only two hours as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With that, he rushed out of the store with empty hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On Christmas Eve, Kamakura was full of people. Wakamiya Avenue, the main road, was naturally crowded. Rather, the further you go, the more people there are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He sprinted towards Mai and looked for Sara at the same time. But it was hard enough just to go forward, let alone find someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result, he arrived at his destination with no luck.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Outside the main store of Pigeon Cake was a white wall in a striking Japanese style. The building was a fusion of modern elements and the antiquity of Kamakura. On the white wall, &quot;Pigeon Cake&quot; was written in black letters against the white background. The white wall with black letters, &#39;Dove Cake&#39;, was very eye-catching against the white.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When she saw Sakuta, Mai ran over and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said with a guilty conscience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you know of any places to rent kimonos around here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think there are a few places in Komachi shopping street ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai took out her phone and searched the map.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Looks like you&#39;re right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The map showed a few stores located on the Komachi street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll go over there and look for her. You look around the stores closeby, the dumpling shop and the cherry blossom store.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Gnocchi store and Sakurabe&#39;s jewelry store, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;ll meet here when we&#39;re done.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai agreed without asking for a reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After writing down the locations of the kimono rental stores, Sakuta went to each one of them. The Komachi shopping street with all kinds of stores was now so crowded with couples and families out shopping that they were forced to stop from time to time. He was forced to stop every now and then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he finally came to a store, there was no sign of Sara. Perhaps it was because of the festive atmosphere, but all the stores were lined up with couples who wanted to wear kimonos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He finally found some clues at the third store after a lot of trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Since it was unlikely that anyone would come to such a store alone at this time of the year, the clerk took note of the person who looked like Sara. It was said that she had changed her kimono about five minutes ago and left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Just a little bit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta thanked the clerk and ran out of the Komachi shopping street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Looking around, he couldn&#39;t find Sara. There were people everywhere, so you couldn&#39;t see more than five meters away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even adults can get lost if they are not careful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After looking around the nearby stores, he decided to turn back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai should be almost back too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;His thoughts were then confirmed. As soon as Sakuta arrived at the entrance of the pigeon cake store, Mai came running from the opposite direction.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Where&#39;s your side?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;She seems to have rented a kimono.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then it must still be on your side, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Maybe.......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;What else is there to know. What else was in Sara&#39;s previous plan ......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you know of any temples full of bamboo, Mai?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The Hokokuji Temple?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you know where it is?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a long walk, isn&#39;t it? We have something in our hands too, so it&#39;s faster to drive.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before she could finish her sentence, Mai was already walking towards the parking lot with various gifts&quot;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai, let me...&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After coming to her side, Saki took the biggest bag.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A yellow can-like object was placed in the yellow and white bag. On the outside was a logo in the shape of a dove.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You can take this to your parents on New Year&#39;s Day.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Aren&#39;t you going?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I&#39;m going with you. I&#39;m going to pay my respects to my parents.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They rushed to the parking lot without a word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They walked for ten minutes to get the car, and then drove for another ten minutes before they saw the Hokokuji Temple. There were already cars parked near the entrance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The parking lot on this side was full, so get out of the car and go find someone.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After confirming that there were no cars behind the side, Sakuta opened the door and got out of the car. At that moment, he felt that the atmosphere around me had changed completely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the opposite of the hustle and bustle of Wakamiya Avenue and Komachi Shopping Street.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The small stones that had fallen on the tarmac were stepped on by him, making an unusually harsh sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He didn&#39;t care about that, and stepped quickly into the temple.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Inside, it was even more silent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Not only is the sound silent, the atmosphere itself is also silent. It felt like the mood was cleansed and gradually calmed down with each step forward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;His pace also slowed down unconsciously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was as if the atmosphere here did not allow him to do so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It felt like the flow of time inside the temple was slowed down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As he walked, he saw the towering bamboo forest. The bamboo was still green and oily in the middle of winter, showing its strong vitality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The view could not help but look upward.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;A little sunlight shone down through the gaps in the bamboo leaves. The bamboo and bamboo leaves also glowed with a dreamy light, as if they were looking at the surface of the water underneath. It was all so dreamlike, as if he had mistakenly entered another world.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;In the path wrapped in bamboo to the left and right and above, he saw a figure looking up at the top of his head, just like him. That person was wearing a kimono, and together with the bamboo forest, it made a dreamy picture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment it was unrecognizable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was wearing a kimono with the same red and white flower pattern and her hair was up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She was the one Sakuta wanted to find.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s nice to see bamboo at Christmas.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ll use the bamboo as a Christmas tree.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara turned her head back, and the small charm on her hairpin shook.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, why are you......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you want me to find you, at least pick a place that&#39;s not so hard to find next time&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta didn&#39;t think he would have found this place if he hadn&#39;t &#39;cheated&#39;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He walked on the stone steps and approached Sara step by step.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Please don&#39;t come over......!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With three steps to go, Sara panicked and tried to run away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you run dressed like this ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--would be dangerous.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before he could finish her sentence, Sara&#39;s wooden shoes got stuck on the stone steps and she landed on her hands and knees like a child.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That hurts......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta immediately rushed to her side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Is everything okay?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He helped her to stand up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......the rented kimono is dirty&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara patted the dust on the knee of her kimono with her hand in a depressed mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &quot;I&#39;m not asking that, I&#39;m asking if you&#39;re hurt&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She had just braced her hand on the ground, and now her palm was red. The good thing was that it wasn&#39;t bruised or bleeding. Sakuta removed the small gravel stone that was attached to her hand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why......!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her &#39;why&#39; might not mean the same as the &#39;why&#39; she said earlier.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Of course I should do my best to search and rescue my own student who is lost.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I knew she wasn&#39;t asking that, but I answered the last &#39;why&#39; first.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s not what I&#39;m asking!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Why aren&#39;t you angry at me for suddenly walking away alone?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Why don&#39;t you ask me why I left alone?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;--Sara was asking that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But he thought such a question was meaningless. Because even if he tells her the answer, she can&#39;t be saved. So he decided to say what he should say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because it&#39;s also time to discuss the next battle plan.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Battle plan......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta&#39;s unintelligible words puzzled her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s the battle plan to make you and Kirishima Touko hit your head hard once&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point, Sara&#39;s expression fell again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I said, &quot;I don&#39;t need to bang my head, it&#39;s okay to bang somewhere else......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said with no confidence as she turned her face away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then why did you hit me with your head?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He had hit his head with Sara before.

She said her heart out regardless. That&#39;s why she was so heartbroken.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Because Sakuta&#39;s answer was plain to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;To be honest, I&#39;m even relieved&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because then I won&#39;t have to take advantage of Himeji-san&#39;s puberty syndrome anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was his true thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;From the day she made an appointment to use her supernatural phenomena, he had been feeling bad about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid Sara knows that too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid Mai feels it too. That&#39;s why she appeared in front of him today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, I&#39;m glad that your syndrome is cured.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really, thank you very much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You know full well what I&#39;m doing with my adolescent syndrome!

Why are you still so gentle with me ......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Because I want to be that person.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You should be angry!

There&#39;s only a three-year difference between us, isn&#39;t there?.......&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s a three-year gap between adults and children.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......too cunning......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara lowered her head, sniffled speechlessly, and cried silently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her shoulders trembled several times, repeating the same action......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally she calmed down-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She said to him in a voice that contained a buzzing nasal sound.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What? You still have a problem with me?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Many, many more.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara finally lifted her head. Her tear-stained eyes looked straight at him with a sense of determination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If only I could be more serious about liking you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;The instructor&#39;s manual for our cram school says that teacher-student relationships are not allowed.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara dried her tears with her fingers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then she forced her usual smile and said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll confess to you after I get into my first choice university.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now there was one more promise. About two years later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the same advice that Sakuta had given to Toranosuke, and he really didn&#39;t expect it to be used on him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s really a tough trick......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s called a curse that comes out of the mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So, how long are you two going to be stuck together?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sound of a voice turned around. It was a displeased Mai who was holding the car keys.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m happy and happy, so I don&#39;t mind if Sakuta-sensei lends me the car for a little while. Adults don&#39;t bully children.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said so forcefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She felt like she had let go of all her burdens.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta is mine, so I can&#39;t&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai refused categorically. She turned around and went back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But after walking a few steps she said to them who didn&#39;t follow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to see Kirishima Touko at the university?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was to see Kirishima Touko that caused all this today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They had lost their trump card to read Kirishima Touko&#39;s mind. However, there was one more thing that Sakuta wanted to confirm no matter what.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After asking Sara to return the rental kimono to the kimono store and picking up the monogram that had been left there, Sakuta and the others left Kamakura.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It had been fifteen minutes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The time would soon be four in the afternoon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;However, there was no sign of the university yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll make it to 4:00.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s all because of me. ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara, who was sitting in the back seat, said guiltily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Himeji-san. Can you use your cell phone to look up Kirishima Tooru-chan?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even if I said to her &#39;don&#39;t care&#39; she would definitely care. So Sakuta chose to ask her to do something. It would distract her by giving her something to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I know.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara replied with a sharp smile and then took out her cell phone...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah ......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Then she let out a sigh of regret.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s already started.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The sound of a song came out of her phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a Christmas song with the sound effect of bells ringing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara held out her phone so that Sakuta, who was sitting in front of her, could see it too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The picture was of a pond in a courtyard with a small bridge over it. Standing on the bridge was the blurry back of the miniskirt Santa. Almost only an outline could be seen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This is the courtyard of the main school building.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason why it looks familiar is because it is in the university&#39;s grounds where Mai and Sakuta attended. The pond that you can see from the classroom every day was in the center of the building, which was surrounded by a circle in the shape of a mouth. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;According to the car&#39;s navigation, the distance to the university was still 2,000 meters. The prediction is that we will arrive within five minutes. But I don&#39;t know if the song will last until they get to the university. A song is only about four, five, or three minutes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I could already see the railroad on the Keikyu line from the front window of the car. I could also see Kanazawa Hakkei Station.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a familiar view around the university.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The car navigation system said, &quot;We will arrive at our destination soon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After all, we could see the main entrance of the university, so we knew we were almost there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai stopped the car in front of the main entrance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll go first.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll get off too.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Sara got out of the car one after another.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;They walked through the main gate and entered the university.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;By this time, Sara could no longer hear Christmas songs on her phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Even so, Sakuta rushed to the atrium of the building at full speed - and had to be careful that Mont Blanc didn&#39;t get knocked off his feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara followed behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Sakuta-sensei, the live broadcast is over.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then you don&#39;t have to worry so much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Don&#39;t worry about accidentally appearing on the broadcast and dying.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After entering the school building, we walked through the corridor to the atrium.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He immediately looked at the pond in the center, on the bridge over the pond. The Christmas miniskirt was coming towards him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally she spotted him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m all finished because you&#39;re so slow.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Can&#39;t you take a little longer for me. I bought you a gift.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Handing the Mont Blanc box to Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;This stuff is not poisoned. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s about to expire.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll have to eat it now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko opened the box and took a bite of an ice cream shaped Mont Blanc in a small cup.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s delicious. Thank you for this wonderful Christmas present.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With that, Touko brushed past Sakuta...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re Iwamizawa Nene-san, aren&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;said Sakuta, turning back to her back. That was one of the things he wanted to confirm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no response.

She kept her back turned to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I am Kirishima Touko&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a very calm tone of voice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But I could feel a strong will.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the most emotionally charged sentence she had ever uttered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The atmosphere suddenly became tense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although I didn&#39;t know what was causing it, I could clearly recognize that something was causing this atmosphere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That, Sakuta-sensei ......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara, who was standing across from Saki-tae across from Tooriko, interjected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Who the hell are you talking to......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara said with fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Touko walked right past Sara. Sara must have seen her, but she didn&#39;t react, she looked at him with a serious face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That means Sara couldn&#39;t see Touko.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;With that, she left the atrium.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;......Is she here now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara looked around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No, she&#39;s not here anymore.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You mean she was here until a moment ago?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;But I can&#39;t see her at all. I could see her when I was reading Sakuta-sensei&#39;s mind.......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Maybe you can only see her by reading my mind.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh ......?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Maybe you can see her only through my eyes.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta himself had experienced clairvoyance so he understood. That was actually a kind of sensory sharing with Sara.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He could see what Sara saw, hear what Sara heard, and feel what Sara felt. So Sara can also see Kirishima Touko through his eyes. Only she herself is not able to see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then, won&#39;t I......be of no use from the beginning......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She quickly understood this and lowered her head in frustration.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m really like a fool.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She gave a self-deprecating smile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s better than coming here with all the energy and expecting nothing, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At Sakuta&#39;s words, she pouted. But she immediately smiled helplessly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s true...I can&#39;t get anything good out of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She deliberately said what was on her mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Today is Christmas Eve......Nothing good can come out of it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ll buy you a cake when I get back, okay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really! That&#39;s great!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sara clapped her hands and cheered wildly. She was also trying to cheer him up. This side of her wouldn&#39;t change easily. But on the other hand, that&#39;s who she is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c2 c4" id="h.l86yyxxzh0l"><span class="c5">Final Chapter: Holy Night </span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In the area that looked like a landscape painting, framed by the balcony&#39;s shade fence and the roof&#39;s rain-sheltered pillars, Sakuta saw the moon that was missing half of its side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was floating alone in the dark sky.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Like the moon, he was alone in the open-air hot springs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no sound from any human being around.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;There was no scent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;All that could be heard was the gentle sound of the wind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The faint sound of swaying trees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;And the sound of water bubbling out of the hot springs around you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This healing feeling spreads from the ears to the whole body.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s so good......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He naturally sighed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Now Sakuta could enjoy the view from the balcony and the open-air hot spring that came straight from each room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing could be more enjoyable than that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;After dropping Sara off at Fujisawa Station, they drove all the way to the hotel in Hakone. They had told the hotel that they would be late.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Although it was already close to 8:00 p.m. when they arrived, the innkeeper was still kind enough to welcome them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta and Mai quickly enjoyed a luxurious and elegant dinner, took a short break, and then came to enjoy the hot springs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s great that each room has an outdoor hot spring.......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After arriving at the hotel, Sakuta knew from the moment he saw the exterior of the inn that it was not a place he could afford to stay alone. After entering the interior of the hotel, seeing the wide courtyard and the interiors of the guest rooms, this thought became more and more firm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was surprising that each room was equipped with an open-air hot spring, but what surprised him the most was that this room had a &#39;second floor&#39;. The first floor was the living room, and the second floor was the bedroom and others. Each room was like a private house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I asked Mai how much it cost for one night, pretending not to think about it. She smiled and replied, &quot;It&#39;s worth it as a gift for your birthday.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">So, he didn&#39;t dare to ask about the exact price again. Sometimes in this world, ignorance is the greatest virtue. If the opportunity is rare, just enjoy it, don&#39;t worry so much, at least give the money back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;At that moment, there was a clattering sound from behind Sakuta.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was the glass sliding door to the balcony that was opened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;How was it? Is the hot spring comfortable?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was Mai in her hotel yukata, freshly showered and wearing a pillow top.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It was great.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Really? That&#39;s good.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What&#39;s it like in the big bath?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;There&#39;s no one there. So you can take a relaxing bath.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Then I&#39;ll swim there afterwards.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The size of the outdoor hot spring in the room is not big enough to swim in. It was just the right size for two adults to go in without being cramped. If it was Sakuta alone, he could do a &quot;big&quot; lie down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t want to get put on the blacklist of this hotel, so don&#39;t mess around&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai said that half seriously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She seemed to think that the current Sakuta could really do something like that. Indeed, if no one stopped him, he might not be able to resist doing it. That&#39;s how high his spirits were at the moment. He was completely absorbed by the atmosphere of the hot spring that was getting to him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;And it would be perfect if I could soak with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta looked at the interior of the room with some hatred. At that moment, Mai&#39;s manager, Ryoko, came back to the guest room. Her cheeks were red from soaking and she was fanning her face with her hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It was thanks to Ryoko-san who checked us in the first place that the reservation was not canceled.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The look in Mai&#39;s eyes said, &quot;You better say thanks&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I am grateful.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The tone of discontent was more obvious than he expected when he said the words.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You really are helpless. It&#39;s cold outside, so I&#39;ll only be with you for a while.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Huh? Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Before he could respond, Mai had already taken off her socks and gone barefoot to the balcony.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s freezing!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">She said so while tiptoeing to the open-air hot spring tub, and then sat sideways on the dry part of the pool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She then grabbed the hem of her yukata by the left and right sides and put her skirt at the knee. Sudden bold behavior knocked Sakuta&#39;s mind through.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai soaked into the hot spring below her knees as if she were soaking her feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Together, the feet placed in the hot springs looked dazzlingly white.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The few strands of hair that fell from her bun made her look very attractive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai, who was sitting in the smoke of the hot spring, had the charm of a mature woman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Are you satisfied now?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;She asked while taking care not to get her yukata wet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Mai&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Why? What&#39;s your problem?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;No. On the contrary. I&#39;m done!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He was so excited, he couldn&#39;t help but make a victory gesture with his hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Don&#39;t move, my yukata will get wet.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai lifted one of her feet up and splashed water forwards.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The water splashed all over his face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ugh!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta tried desperately to brush the water away with his hands. Mai laughed happily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh, by the way, Futaba-san just sent you a message.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai pulled her cell phone out of her yukata jacket pocket.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What did it say?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;If you&#39;re with Sakuta, can you lend him to me for a minute? Why don&#39;t you call?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Mai handed him the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Rio is looking for, is it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He could probably think of what it was. So to be honest, he didn&#39;t really want to answer the phone. But Mai had already dialed Rio&#39;s number when she handed him the phone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;When he put his ear to it, he could hear the communication tone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;He picked up right away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Good evening, this is Futaba.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Rio answered the phone politely. Since the call was from Mai&#39;s cell phone, it was possible that the other party was Mai.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Hello, hello, hello, it&#39;s me.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as Sakuta spoke, a sigh came from the other side. It didn&#39;t mean &#12302;relieved&#12303; or &#12302;disappointed&#12303;, but rather &#12302;I&#39;m going to punish you next&#12303;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa, you definitely said something strange to Kasai-kun, didn&#39;t you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What happened?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If Toranosuke&#39;s dream had come true, today would have been the day that Rio replied to his confession.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;After I said &#39;I can&#39;t go out with a student&#39;, he said &#39;Please think about it again after I get into my first choice university&#39;.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really good, Kasai-san.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;d say. You must have taught him to do that, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;If it were me, I wouldn&#39;t say, &#39;Please reconsider,&#39; I&#39;d just say, &#39;Please go out with me.&#39;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That&#39;s actually what Sakuta said to Toranosuke. The introverted Toranosuke chose to be more subtle. Or maybe it&#39;s just that he can&#39;t say &quot;please go out with me&quot; shamelessly......</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Azusagawa, you are fully responsible&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What responsibility?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Do you think I can continue to counsel him after he told me that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I think it&#39;s embarrassing for both sides.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;If he can get into the university he wants to go to, he can confess again. It would be a bizarre relationship if he had to ask Rio to tutor him for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;So take the responsibility to get him into the first choice university.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He had a bad feeling about this.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Uh, I remember that Kasai-san&#39;s first choice is......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s the university I went to.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a national science and technology university with a very high deviation value. Sakuta&#39;s ability is not enough for that university.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s all I have to say. Then please tell Sakurajima that I&#39;m sorry to bother you. That&#39;s all. Bye.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Ah wait, Futaba......&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;The phone was already hung up. And the call lasted exactly one minute, no less.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta gave the phone back to Mai without a word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What did Futaba-san say?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m sorry to have bothered you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Oh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, there was more to the conversation than that. Mai could also understand something from the conversation. But she didn&#39;t ask more questions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;I guess she didn&#39;t think it was necessary to talk about it now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a hot spring inn in Hakone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sakuta was here, and Mai was here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Although they were not alone, such a cozy time is precious, and every second of it must be cherished.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Sakuta was in the same mood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;But no matter how happy the time was, it would come to an end.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Come back early, don&#39;t catch a cold&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Ryoko calmly reminded Mai and Sakuta. She looked at them from the entrance of the balcony with a meaningful expression. It was exactly the expression of an elderly person who was gently watching over a couple who were having a good time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;It also confirmed how fulfilling their time had been.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Thank you very much for today, Mai&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Mai had a moment of doubt, but she didn&#39;t ask back, &quot;Thank you for what?&quot; Instead, she just smiled and said...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;Her expression was one of happiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;That was happiness.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp;On that day, Sakuta, who was alone in the living room on the first floor, had a dream.
